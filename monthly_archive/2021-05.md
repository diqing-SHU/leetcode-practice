A common algorithm to generate prime numbers: [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

The general idea is to mark all multiples of a non-prime in a dictionary until we reach `sqrt(n)`. Then unmarked numbers are the prime numbers.

Bitmask is a good approach to do comparison based on bits. Main idea is use `&` on two binary numbers (can be representation of string), result of 0 indicates that there is no overlaps.
