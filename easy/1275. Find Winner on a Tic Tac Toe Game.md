# 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game

## Question

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players  _A_  and  _B_  on a _3_ x _3_ grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
- The first player  _A_  always places "X" characters, while the second player  _B_ always places "O" characters.
- "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
- The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given an array  `moves`  where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which  _A_  and  _B_  play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (_A_  or  _B_), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that `moves`  is **valid**  (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and  _A_  will play  **first**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
**Output:** "A"
**Explanation:** "A" wins, he always plays first.
"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "**X**  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " **X** "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OO**X**"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
**Output:** "B"
**Explanation:** "B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XX**O**"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "X**O** "
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "**O**  "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
**Output:** "Draw"
**Explanation:** The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
"XXO"
"OOX"
"XOX"

**Example 4:**

**Input:** moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]
**Output:** "Pending"
**Explanation:** The game has not finished yet.
"X  "
" O "
"   "

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
- `moves[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2`
- There are no repeated elements on  `moves`.
- `moves`  follow the rules of tic tac toe.

## Solution

### Approach 1: One check

#### Intuition

Since the moves are always valid, we just need to check after all the moves are made.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass and place all moves
2. Check if we have winner
3. If we have, return the winner
4. Otherwise, check if we have made 9 moves(all filled -> draw). If not(still space left -> pending)

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def tictactoe(self, moves: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        def checkWin():
            # check row
            if graph[0][0] == graph[0][1] == graph[0][2]:
                return graph[0][0]
            if graph[1][0] == graph[1][1] == graph[1][2]:
                return graph[1][0]
            if graph[2][0] == graph[2][1] == graph[2][2]:
                return graph[2][0]
            # check col
            if graph[0][0] == graph[1][0] == graph[2][0]:
                return graph[0][0]
            if graph[0][1] == graph[1][1] == graph[2][1]:
                return graph[0][1]
            if graph[0][2] == graph[1][2] == graph[2][2]:
                return graph[0][2]
            # check diagonal
            if graph[0][0] == graph[1][1] == graph[2][2]:
                return graph[1][1]
            if graph[0][2] == graph[1][1] == graph[2][0]:
                return graph[1][1]
            return False
        graph = [['','',''], ['','',''], ['','','']]
        for i, (row, col) in enumerate(moves):
            if i%2 == 0:
                graph[row][col] = 'A'
            else:
                graph[row][col] = 'B'
        
        winRes = checkWin()
        if winRes and winRes != '':
            return winRes
        if len(moves) == 9:
            return "Draw"
        else:
            return "Pending"
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  One pass moves and one pass all checks

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Store graph
