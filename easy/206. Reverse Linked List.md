# 206. Reverse Linked List

## Question

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

**Input:** 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
**Output:** 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Solution

**Approach 1: Iterative**
While traversing through the linked list, for each node we do the following:

1. Change the current node's next pointer to point to its previous element (append to the start of previous element)
2. Store its previous element (result from previous run)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:  
        prev = None
        while head:
            curr = head
            head = head.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
        return prev
```

To further simplify the code, we can use inline method for swapping values:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:  
        prev, curr = None, head
        while curr:
            curr.next, prev, curr = prev, curr, curr.next
        return prev
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) one loop through the linked list

SC:O(1)

----------

**Approach 2: Recursive**
Start with curr:

1. if curr is None return. Odd case, return None (curr)
2. if curr.next is None. We reach the end and this is the new head, so return it (curr)
3. recursively traverse to stack calls til we reach the end (boundary cases)
4. each call stack will swap the two nodes:
 1. point curr.next.next to curr
 2. point curr.next to None

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode: 
  if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        p = self.reverseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        return p 
```

Start with curr:

1. if curr is None return previous linked list (reach the end)
2. recursively traverse to stack calls til we reach the end (boundary cases):
    1. get curr.next (the next node to proceed)
    2. point curr.next to prev (append to the start of previous linked list)
    3. for next call stack pass in the next node and new previous linked list to proceed

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode: 
        def reverse(node, prev=None):
            if not node:
                return prev
            n = node.next
            node.next = prev
            return reverse(n, node)
        return reverse(head)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) One loop through the linked list

SC:O(n) The recursion could go up to n levels deep.
