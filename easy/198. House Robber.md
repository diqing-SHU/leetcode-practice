Question:
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 400

Answer:

[8, 1, 3, 10, 7]

using DP, needs to find patterns. dp[0] will just be 8. dp[1] we need to decide bewteen 8 and 1 so 8
dp[2] we need to decide whether we keep dp[1] or we us dp[0] plus current value 3. in this case 11 > 8. so dp[3] is 11
it goes the same for the rest of dp array. each dp is the max money we can get when adding the value at the postion into consideration

[8, 8, 11, 18, 18]

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp = []
        dp.append(nums[0])
        dp.append(max(nums[0],nums[1]))
        i = 2
        for i in range(2,len(nums)):
            dp.append(max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+nums[i]))
        return dp[len(nums)-1]
```
