# 198. House Robber

  

## Question:


You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and  **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight  **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
## Solution:

**Approach 1: DP**
[8, 1, 3, 10, 7]

  

using DP, needs to find patterns. dp[0] will just be 8. dp[1] we need to decide bewteen 8 and 1 so 8

dp[2] we need to decide whether we keep dp[1] or we us dp[0] plus current value 3. in this case 11 > 8. so dp[3] is 11

it goes the same for the rest of dp array. each dp is the max money we can get when adding the value at the postion into consideration

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp = []
        dp.append(nums[0])
        dp.append(max(nums[0],nums[1]))
        i = 2
        for i in range(2,len(nums)):
            dp.append(max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+nums[i]))
        return dp[len(nums)-1]
```
