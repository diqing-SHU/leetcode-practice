# 1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum

## Question

Given an array of integers `nums`, you start with an initial  **positive**  value  _startValue__._

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of  _startValue_ plus elements in  `nums` (from left to right).

Return the minimum  **positive**  value of _startValue_  such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** If you choose startValue = 4, in the third iteration your step by step sum is less than 1.
 **step by step sum
                startValue = 4 | startValue = 5 | nums**                  (4 **-3** ) = 1  | (5 **-3** ) = 2    |  -3
                  (1 **+2** ) = 3  | (2 **+2** ) = 4    |   2
                  (3 **-3** ) = 0  | (4 **-3** ) = 1    |  -3
                  (0 **+4** ) = 4  | (1 **+4** ) = 5    |   4
                  (4 **+2** ) = 6  | (5 **+2** ) = 7    |   2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Minimum start value should be positive.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,-2,-3]
**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

If we increase the initial value, all step sums will also increase for the same amount. Therefore, we can start with 0 and get the minium step sum. Then we return the increase needed to make it larger than 1

#### Algorithm

1. One pass and find minimum step sum
2. return the increase needed

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        minSum, stepSum = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            stepSum += num
            minSum = min(stepSum, minSum)
        if minSum > 1:
            return 0
        return 1-minSum
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  One pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, Constant extra space
