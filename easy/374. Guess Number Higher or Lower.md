# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## Question

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from  `1`  to  `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API  `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

- `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e.  `pick < num`).
- `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e.  `pick > num`).
- `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e.  `pick == num`).

Return  _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 2, pick = 2
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231  - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Binary search

#### Intuition

Use binary search technique to find the number

#### Algorithm

1. Binary search on the number range
2. Move lo/hi based on results from api
3. Stop if we find the number

#### Code

```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        if guess(1) == 0:
            return 1
        if guess(n) == 0:
            return n
        lo, hi = 1, n
        while lo < hi:
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) //2
            if guess(mid) > 0:
                lo = mid + 1
            elif guess(mid) < 0:
                hi = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
        return lo
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(logn)`,  binary search

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, Constant extra space
