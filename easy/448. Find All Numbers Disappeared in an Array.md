# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

## Question

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤  _n_  (_n_  = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1,  _n_] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

**Input:**
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

**Output:**
[5,6]

## Solution

**Approach 1: Hash Map**
Use a dictionary dude
**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n), one loop through
  
SC:O(n), hash map

---

**Approach 2: Hash List**

Since `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array)`, we can treat this list as a hash map and start from there.
Switch the sign to indicate that we visited already. Then go through it again to generate result with positive value.

```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        for num in nums:
            if nums[abs(num)-1] > 0:
                nums[abs(num)-1] = -nums[abs(num)-1]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                res.append(i+1)
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) , Two loops
  
SC:O(1), No extra space
