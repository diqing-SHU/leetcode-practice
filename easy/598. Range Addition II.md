# 598. Range Addition II

## Question

You are given an  `m x n`  matrix  `M`  initialized with all  `0`'s and an array of operations  `ops`, where  `ops[i] = [ai, bi]`  means  `M[x][y]`  should be incremented by one for all  `0 <= x < ai`  and  `0 <= y < bi`.

Count and return  _the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/ex1.jpg)

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104`
- `0 <= ops.length <= 104`
- `ops[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai  <= m`
- `1 <= bi  <= n`

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

Based on the description of the problem, we can see its a range merge question. however, all the squares starts with top-left at (0, 0). Which means the smaller squares will have all the addition from larger ones. In another word, the question turns to finding the size of the smallest square (non-zero).

#### Algorithm

1. Loop through ops
2. Keep track of the smallest a and b
3. return the minimum square size

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # all ops start with 0, 0
        minA, minB = m, n
        for a, b in ops:
            minA, minB = min(minA, a), min(minB, b)
        return minA*minB
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  one pass all ops

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, constant space
