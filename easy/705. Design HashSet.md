# 705. Design HashSet


## Question:

Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

-   `add(value)`: Insert a value into the HashSet.
-   `contains(value)`  : Return whether the value exists in the HashSet or not.
-   `remove(value)`: Remove a value in the HashSet. If the value does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.

  
**Example:**

MyHashSet hashSet = new MyHashSet();
hashSet.add(1);         
hashSet.add(2);         
hashSet.contains(1);    // returns true
hashSet.contains(3);    // returns false (not found)
hashSet.add(2);          
hashSet.contains(2);    // returns true
hashSet.remove(2);          
hashSet.contains(2);    // returns false (already removed)

  
**Note:**

-   All values will be in the range of  `[0, 1000000]`.
-   The number of operations will be in the range of `[1, 10000]`.
-   Please do not use the built-in HashSet library.

## Solution:

**Approach 1: List Operation**
First approach comes to my mind since the range is not too big.
Not exactly a hash set through. So the performance is bad
```python
class MyHashSet:
    hashSet = []

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.hashSet = []

    def add(self, key: int) -> None:
        for num in self.hashSet:
            if num == key:
                return
        self.hashSet.append(key)

    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:
        for i in range(len(self.hashSet)):
            if self.hashSet[i] == key:
                self.hashSet.pop(i)
                return

    def contains(self, key: int) -> bool:
        """
        Returns true if this set contains the specified element
        """
        for num in self.hashSet:
            if num == key:
                return True
        return False
```

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) go through whole list for every operation

SC:O(n) the hash list

---

**Approach 2: Actual HashSet with Open Addressing**
We can design a actual HashSet with a fixed length list to store the data. 
The list expands itself by a factor of 2 when the load factor (size divided by array spots) exceeds 2/3.
- This will allow for O(1) operations on average. 
- The downside to this is that every time the hashset doubles, it has to create a new list and rehash every element which takes O(n) each time.
- The average time will be O(1) for each add call as the cost of rehashing the set is amortized over the calls.

If we **add** an element that is hashed to the same index as another key, then we apply a secondary operation (*secondary hash*) on the index until we find an empty spot (or a previously removed spot). This is called **double hashing**.
- The formula I used is similar to that of the Python dict implementation, but without the perturb part. This is better than linear probing since the hash function (which just mods the key by the capacity of the list) is likely to fill contiguous array spots and double hashing makes the probability of finding an empty spot more uniform in those cases than linear probing.

For **removing**, the removed element is replaced by a tombstone so that the contains function won't get messed up when the path to an existing element has an empty spot in it, causing the contains function to return false. The add function will know that tombstones are able to be replaced by new elements.
```python
class MyHashSet:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.capacity = 8
        self.size = 0
        self.s = [None]*8
        self.lf = float(2)/3
    
    def myHash(self, key):
        return key%self.capacity
    
    def secondHash(self, key):
        return (5*key + 1)%self.capacity
    
    def add(self, key: int) -> None:
        # check if we need to increase capacity of set
        if float(self.size)/self.capacity >= self.lf:
            # bit shift to left by 1 and create the new set ns
            self.capacity <<= 1
            ns = [None]*self.capacity
            # put old values back in the new set ns
            for i in range(self.capacity >> 1):
	            # removed spot
                if self.s[i] and self.s[i] != "==TOMBSTONE==":
                    n = self.myHash(self.s[i])
                    while ns[n] is not None:
                        # apply second hash untill we find a spot
                        n = self.secondHash(n)
                    ns[n] = self.s[i]
            # update our set
            self.s = ns
        h = self.myHash(key)
        while self.s[h] is not None:
            if self.s[h] == key:

    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:

        while self.s[h]:
            if self.s[h] == key:
                # mark as removed
                self.s[h] = "==TOMBSTONE=="
                self.size -= 1
                return
            # apply second hash untill we find the key
            h = self.secondHash(h)

    def contains(self, key: int) -> bool:

        """
        h = self.myHash(key)
        while self.s[h] is not None:
            if self.s[h] == key:
                return True

**Complexity Analysis**

  
TC:O(1), hash solution is close to O(1)

SC:O(n) hash set
