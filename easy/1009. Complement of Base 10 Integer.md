# 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

## Question

The  **complement**  of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the  `0`'s to  `1`'s and all the  `1`'s to  `0`'s in its binary representation.

- For example, The integer  `5`  is  `"101"`  in binary and its  **complement**  is  `"010"`  which is the integer  `2`.

Given an integer  `n`, return  _its complement_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n < 109`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Math

#### Intuition

The two numbers will add up to n+1 bits of 1s. So we just need to use that to substract given number.
10 in binary is 1010, its complement is 101.  
1010 + 101 = 1111 = 10000 - 1  
101 = 1000 - 1 - 1010

#### Algorithm

1. Get the first sum above the number
2. Substract the number

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, N):
         return (1<<(len(bin(N)) - 2)) - 1 - N
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(log N)` to find its length

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(log N)` to keep binary representation of our number.
