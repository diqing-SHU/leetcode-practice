# 441. Arranging Coins

## Question

You have  `n`  coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of  `k`  rows where the  `ith`  row has exactly  `i`  coins. The last row of the staircase  **may be**  incomplete.

Given the integer  `n`, return  _the number of  **complete rows**  of the staircase you will build_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231  - 1`

## Solution

### Approach 1: BF

#### Intuition

The range for n is small, we can just check for all possible levels until we cant build

#### Algorithm

1. Keep building levels until we cant
2. return the number of completed levels

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        level = 1
        while (level+1)*level/2 <= n:
            level+=1
        return level - 1    
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  Check all possible levels

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, Constant extra space

### Approach 2: Binary search

#### Intuition

We can further improve time with binary search

#### Algorithm

1. Run binary search to find closest right

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, n
        while left <= right:
            k = (right + left) // 2
            curr = k * (k + 1) // 2
            if curr == n:
                return k
            if n < curr:
                right = k - 1
            else:
                left = k + 1
        return right
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(logn)`,  Binary search

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, Constant extra space
