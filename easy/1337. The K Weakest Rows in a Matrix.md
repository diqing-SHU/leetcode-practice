# 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

## Question

You are given an  `m x n`  binary matrix  `mat`  of  `1`'s (representing soldiers) and  `0`'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned  **in front**  of the civilians. That is, all the  `1`'s will appear to the  **left**  of all the  `0`'s in each row.

A row  `i`  is  **weaker**  than a row  `j`  if one of the following is true:

- The number of soldiers in row  `i`  is less than the number of soldiers in row  `j`.
- Both rows have the same number of soldiers and  `i < j`.

Return  _the indices of the_ `k` _**weakest**  rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat =
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]],
k = 3
**Output:** [2,0,3]
**Explanation:**
The number of soldiers in each row is:

- Row 0: 2
- Row 1: 4
- Row 2: 1
- Row 3: 2
- Row 4: 5
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat =
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]],
k = 2
**Output:** [0,2]
**Explanation:**
The number of soldiers in each row is:

- Row 0: 1
- Row 1: 4
- Row 2: 1
- Row 3: 1
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [0,2,3,1].

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `2 <= n, m <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= m`
- `matrix[i][j]`  is either 0 or 1.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Sort

#### Intuition

We can calculate the strength for all rows and sort them to get the weakest k. We can replace the linear search with binaray search, or/and the strength array with min heap for strength. But overall, the time complexity is similar.

#### Algorithm

1. Prepare the strength array along with index
2. Sort the strength array
3. Return the index of the weakest k

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def kWeakestRows(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        strengthRank = []
        for i, row in enumerate(mat):
            # can replace with binary search
            rowSum = sum(row)
            # can replace with heap
            strengthRank.append([rowSum, i])
        strengthRank.sort()
        res = []
        for i in range(k):
            res.append(strengthRank[i][1])
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(nlogn)` , Bottleneck is the sort. Then we do a one pass.

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , extra array to hold the strength

### Approach 2: Vertical scan

#### Intuition

We can utilize the fact that each row shares the same length and are all sorted(1s before 0s).
We can scan each column and count the first 0s we encountered. That indicates the weakest row at the time.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all nodes and add to result array if we encountered 0 for the first time for one row
2. If we dont have enough weakest nodes, loop through all 1s and fill as many as we need.
4. Return the answer

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def kWeakestRows(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        res = []
        row, col = 0, 0
        while len(res) < k and col < n:
            if row not in res and mat[row][col] == 0:
                res.append(row)
            # move our pointers
            row += 1
            if row == m:
                row, col = 0, col+1
        # Fill all 1 rows if we need to
        while len(res) < k:
            if row not in res:
                res.append(row)
            row += 1
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , Worst case one pass all elements
- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , We need to hold our results
