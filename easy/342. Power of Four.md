## Question:

  
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 16
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 5
**Output:** false

**Follow up**: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Recursion**

Basic idea is to keep dividing the number by 4 until we have a number equal to (True) or smaller than 4 (False).
negative numbers and 1 are special cases, we can just return the answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, num: int) -> bool:
        def recurr(num):
            if num > 4:
                return recurr(num/4)
            elif num == 4:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        if num<0:
            return False
        elif num == 1:
            return True
        else:
            return recurr(num)
```

  

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) goes through every division

  

SC:O(n) we have recursion call stack

**Approach 2: Bit Masking**


Consider the valid numbers within 32 bit, and turn them into binary form, they are:

```
1
100
10000
1000000
100000000
10000000000
1000000000000
100000000000000
10000000000000000
1000000000000000000
100000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000000000
100000000000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000000000000000
```

Any other number not it the list should be considered as invalid.  
So if you XOR them altogether, you will get a mask value, which is:

```
1010101010101010101010101010101 (1431655765)
```

Any number which is power of 4, it should be power of 2, I use num &(num-1) == 0 to make sure of that.  
Obviously 0 is not power of 4, I have to check it.  
and finally I need to check that if the number 'AND' the mask value is itself, to make sure it's in the list above.

here comes the final code:


```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, num: int) -> bool:
		# check 0 first
		# use mask to filter power of 4 from power of 2 numbers
        return num != 0 and num &(num-1) == 0 and num & 1431655765== num
```
