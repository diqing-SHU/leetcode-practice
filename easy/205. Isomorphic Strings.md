# 205. Isomorphic Strings

## Question

Given two strings  `s`  and  `t`,  _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings  `s`  and  `t`  are isomorphic if the characters in  `s`  can be replaced to get  `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s`  and  `t`  consist of any valid ascii character.

## Solution

### Approach 1: 2 Hashmaps

#### Intuition

By adopting hashmap, we can reduce look up time for existing mapping to O(1). Since we want to make sure each char is mapped to another both ways. We can use 2 Hashmaps to store the mapping in both directions.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass the two lists
2. Check if each pair conflicts with existing mappings. Return False once such mismatch is found
3. Return True once all pairs are processed

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        mapDict1, mapDict2 = {}, {}
        for char1, char2 in zip(s, t):
            if (char1 in mapDict1 and mapDict1[char1] != char2) or (char2 in mapDict2 and mapDict2[char2] != char1):
                return False
            mapDict1[char1] = char2
            mapDict2[char2] = char1
        return True
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, One pass
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, 2 Hashmaps
