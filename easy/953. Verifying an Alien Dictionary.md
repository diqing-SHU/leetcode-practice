# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

  

## Question:



In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different  `order`. The `order`  of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of  `words` written in the alien language, and the  `order`  of the alphabet, return  `true`  if and only if the given  `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character ([More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order)).

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
-   `order.length == 26`
-   All characters in  `words[i]`  and  `order`  are English lowercase letters.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Compare adjacent words**

Write our own compare function which does the comparison based on the order we get. By storing the order into HashMap we can reduce our lookup time to O(1).

```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        # corner case, no need to use space
        if len(words) == 1:
            return True
        charIndexMap = {}
        for i, char in enumerate(order):
            charIndexMap[char] = i
        def compareFunc(word1, word2):
            p = 0
            while p<len(word1) and p<len(word2):
                if charIndexMap[word1[p]] > charIndexMap[word2[p]]:
                    return False
                elif charIndexMap[word1[p]] < charIndexMap[word2[p]]:
                    return True
                else:
                    p+=1
            if p<len(word1):
                return False
            if p<len(word2):
                return True
            # if words are exactly same, it will come to here
            return True
        for i in range(len(words)-1):
            if not compareFunc(words[i], words[i+1]):
                return False
        return True
```

**Complexity Analysis**


TC:O(n) One pass all words.

SC:O(n) Order dict which has size 26. It has fixed size, so I think O(1) is also correct
