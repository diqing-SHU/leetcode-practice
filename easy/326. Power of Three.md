# 326. Power of Three

## Question:


Given an integer  `n`, return  _`true`  if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return  `false`_.

An integer  `n`  is a power of three, if there exists an integer  `x`  such that  `n == 3x`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 27
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 0
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 9
**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 45
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

-   `-231  <= n <= 231  - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
## Solution:

**Approach 1: Recursion**
Not much. Top-down approach
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        if n == 1:
            return True
        if n%3 != 0:
            return False
        return self.isPowerOfThree(n//3)
```
  

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(log3n) need to recur back to 1

SC:O(log3n) recursion stack

----------

**Approach 2: Iterative with Memorization**
Calculate k up to 3^k is higher or equal to n, keep the result so we save time on calculated ones
  
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.calculatedSet = set([1])
        self.currValue = 1
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        if n in self.calculatedSet:
            return True
        while self.currValue < n:
            self.currValue*=3
            self.calculatedSet.add(self.currValue)
        # recheck now, n >= self.currValue
        if n == self.currValue:
            return True
        return False

```
**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(log3n) need to bottom up to n

SC:O(n), space can go up to all possible values. Or O(1) if we don't save them

----------

**Approach 3: Mathematics**

We can use mathematics as follows

![n = 3^i \\ i = \log_3(n) \\ i = \frac{\log_b(n)}{\log_b(3)}n=3ii=log3​(n)i=logb​(3)logb​(n)​](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%20=%203%5Ei%20%5C%5C%20i%20=%20%5Clog_3%28n%29%20%5C%5C%20i%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog_b%28n%29%7D%7B%5Clog_b%283%29%7D)

`n` is a power of three if and only if `i` is an integer. In Java, we check if a number is an integer by taking the decimal part (using `% 1`) and checking if it is 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return (math.log10(n) / math.log10(3)) % 1 == 0;
```

This solution is problematic because we start using  `double`s, which means we are subject to precision errors. This means, we should never use  `==`  when comparing  `double`s. That is because the result of  `Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3)`  could be  `5.0000001`  or  `4.9999999`. This effect can be observed by using the function  `math.log()`  instead of  `Math.log10()`.

In order to fix that, we need to compare the result against an  `epsilon`. (In Java)
  
  

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(1), It depends on the time for log operation. The implementation in python takes O(1) time

  

SC:O(1) No extra space

**Approach 4: Integer Limitations**

  
we will use that `3` is **prime** number, so if we take number `3^19`, then it is divisible by powers of `3` and by only them. Why we choose `3^19`? Because it is the biggest power of `3`, which fits in int32.

Therefore, the possible values of `n` where we should return `true` are 3^030, 3^131 ... 3^{19}319. Since 3 is a prime number, the only divisors of 3^{19}319 are 3^030, 3^131 ... 3^{19}319, therefore all we need to do is divide 3^{19}319 by `n`. A remainder of **0** means `n` is a divisor of 3^{19}319 and therefore a power of three.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n):
        return 0 if n <= 0 else 1162261467 % n == 0
```
