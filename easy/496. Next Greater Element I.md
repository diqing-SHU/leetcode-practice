# 496. Next Greater Element I

## Question

The  **next greater element**  of some element  `x`  in an array is the  **first greater**  element that is  **to the right**  of  `x`  in the same array.

You are given two  **distinct 0-indexed**  integer arrays  `nums1`  and  `nums2`, where  `nums1`  is a subset of  `nums2`.

For each  `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index  `j`  such that  `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`  and determine the  **next greater element**  of  `nums2[j]`  in  `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is  `-1`.

Return  _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `nums1.length` _such that_ `ans[i]` _is the  **next greater element**  as described above._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
**Output:** [-1,3,-1]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:

- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [3,-1]
**Explanation:** The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:

- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104`
- All integers in  `nums1`  and  `nums2`  are  **unique**.
- All the integers of  `nums1`  also appear in  `nums2`.

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?

## Solution

### Approach 1: Min stack

#### Intuition

The size is small, BF is a valid option here. However, there is a better solution. We use a stack to keep a **decreasing** sub-sequence, whenever we see a number `x` greater than `stack.peek()` we pop all elements less than `x` and for all the popped ones, their next greater element is `x`

#### Algorithm

1. Suppose we have a decreasing sequence followed by a greater number. For example [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6] then the greater number 6 is the next greater element for all previous numbers in the sequence.
2. We use a stack to keep a decreasing sub-sequence, whenever we see a number x greater than stack.peek() we pop all elements less than x and for all the popped ones, their next greater element is x.
3. For example [9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1, 6]. The stack will first contain [9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1] and then we see 6 which is greater than 1 so we pop 1 2 3 whose next greater element should be 6.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        cache, st = {}, []
        for x in nums2:
         # No element in stack yet
            if len(st) == 0:
                st.append(x)
            # Haven't find next greater yet
            elif x <= st[-1]:
                st.append(x)
            # Find next greater
            else:
             # Fill as many as possible
                while st and st[-1] < x:
                    cache[st.pop()] = x
                # Put current one in
                st.append(x)
        result = []
        # Fill in results
        for x in nums1:
            if x in cache:
                result.append(cache[x])
            else:
                result.append(-1)
        return result
```

Simplify the solution

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        cache, st = {}, []
        for x in nums2:
         # Always try to fill
            while st and st[-1] < x:
                cache[st.pop()] = x
            # Always put current one in
            st.append(x)
        # Default to cant find
        result = [-1]*len(nums1)
        for idx,x in enumerate(nums1):
         # Update if we have
            if x in cache:
                result[idx] = cache[x]
        return result
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Iterate all nums

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, To store results and nextGreater dict
