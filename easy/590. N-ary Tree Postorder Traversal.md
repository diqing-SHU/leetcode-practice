# 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

  

  

## Question:

Given an n-ary tree, return the  _postorder_  traversal of its nodes' values.

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)._

**Follow up:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
**Output:** [5,6,3,2,4,1]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
**Output:** [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1]

**Constraints:**

-   The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to  `1000`
-   The total number of nodes is between  `[0, 10^4]`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Iterative**
**Iteration** is basically pre-order traversal but rather than go left, go right first then reverse its result.
Since pre-order is reverse of post-order. Smart!
```python
class Solution:
    def postorder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[int]:
        res = []
        if root == None: return res
        stack = [root]
        while stack:
            curr = stack.pop()
            res.append(curr.val)
            stack.extend(curr.children)

        return res[::-1]
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**

O(n)  goes trough all nodes

**SC**

O(n) res and list

---

**Approach 2: Recursive**
Not much to say. Use DFS.

```python
class Solution:
    def postorder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[int]:
        def dfs(node, res):
            if node:
                for child in node.children:
                    dfs(child,res)
                res.append(node.val)
            else:
                return
        res = []
        dfs(root, res)
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) One pass

SC:O(n) Res list
