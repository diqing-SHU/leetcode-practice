# 997. Find the Town Judge

## Question

In a town, there are  `n`  people labeled from  `1`  to  `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties  **1**  and  **2**.

You are given an array  `trust`  where  `trust[i] = [ai, bi]`  representing that the person labeled  `ai`  trusts the person labeled  `bi`.

Return  _the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= trust.length <= 104`
- `trust[i].length == 2`
- All the pairs of  `trust`  are  **unique**.
- `ai  != bi`
- `1 <= ai, bi  <= n`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Hashmap

#### Intuition

Use hashmap to keep track of trusts for each person

#### Algorithm

We can use a hashmap to store trusts.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(trust) == 0 and n == 1:
            return 1
        trustDict, trustSet = {}, set()
        for trustA, trustB in trust:
            if trustB not in trustDict:
                trustDict[trustB] = 0
            trustDict[trustB] += 1
            trustSet.add(trustA)
        for trustB in trustDict:
            if trustDict[trustB] == n-1 and trustB not in trustSet:
                return trustB
        return -1
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), one pass the array

- **Space Complexity:** O(n), our hashmap
