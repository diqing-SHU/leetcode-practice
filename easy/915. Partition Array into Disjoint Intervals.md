# 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

## Question

Given an integer array  `nums`  where the elements are sorted in  **ascending order**, convert  _it to a  **height-balanced**  binary search tree_.

A  **height-balanced**  binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
**Output:** [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
**Explanation:** [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/btree.jpg)

**Input:** nums = [1,3]
**Output:** [3,1]
**Explanation:** [1,3] and [3,1] are both a height-balanced BSTs.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104  <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums`  is sorted in a  **strictly increasing**  order.
  
## Solution

### Approach 1: Recursion

#### Intuition

Since the array is sorted and we are building a BST. We can use recursion to help building the tree, node by node. Starting from the middle (root)

#### Algorithm

1. Pick middle element to build node. recursion down left and right to build left/right child

2. Base case is when no element is available to build. We return None to stop recursion

#### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return None
        mid = len(nums)//2
        node = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        node.left = self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[:mid])
        node.right = self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid+1:])
        return node
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all nodes are visited

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, build all the nodes
