# 35. Search Insert Position

  

## Question:


Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,3,5,6], 5
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,3,5,6], 2
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [1,3,5,6], 7
**Output:** 4

**Example 4:**

**Input:** [1,3,5,6], 0
**Output:** 0

## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: binary search**
This is a very simple binary search. (Surprisingly, all the binary search solutions I found here are much longer than mine.)  
The first solution only works when there is no duplicate. In this case, we return `mid` whenever `nums[mid]==target`. The second solution deals with the case where duplicates are allowed.  
Note that it would exit the `while` loop ONLY when `target` is not in `nums`. When this happens, the if and else statement in the last loop will also adjust `l` so we simply return l at the end.

For input without duplicates:
```python
def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
    l , r = 0, len(nums)-1
    while l <= r:
        mid=(l+r)/2
        if nums[mid]== target:
            return mid
        if nums[mid] < target:
            l = mid+1
        else:
            r = mid-1
    return l

```

----------

For input with duplicates, we only need a little bit modification:

```python
def searchInsert(self, nums, target): # works even if there are duplicates. 
    l , r = 0, len(nums)-1
    while l <= r:
        mid=(l+r)/2
        if nums[mid] < target:
            l = mid+1
        else:
            if nums[mid]== target and nums[mid-1]!=target:
                return mid
            else:
                r = mid-1
    return l
```
