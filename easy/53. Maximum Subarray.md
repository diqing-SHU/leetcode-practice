# 53. Maximum Subarray

  

## Question:
Given an integer array  `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

**Input:** [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(_n_) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: DP**


Go over the list while track and updating currMax (max of nums[i] and currMax+nums[i]), also update max_so_far if its greater than current one. Once we reach the end we have the solution

Actually a 1-d DP

```python
class  Solution:
    def  maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        currMax = nums[0]
        max_so_far = nums[0]
        for i in  range(1,n):
            currMax = max(nums[i],currMax +nums[i])
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far,currmax)
        return max_so_far
```
