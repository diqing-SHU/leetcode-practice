Question:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        currmax = nums[0]
        max_so_far = nums[0]
        for i in range(1,n):
            currmax = max(nums[i],currmax+nums[i])
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far,currmax)
        return max_so_far

Go over the list while track and updating currmax(nums[i] and currmax+nums[i]), also update max_so_far if its greater than current one. Once we reach the end we have the solution

TC: O(n)
SC: O(1)
