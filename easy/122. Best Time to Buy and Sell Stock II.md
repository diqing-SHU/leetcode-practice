# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

  

  

  

## Question:

  
You are given an array  `prices`  where  `prices[i]`  is the price of a given stock on the  `ith`  day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:**  You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

  

## Solution:

  

  

  
  

**Approach 1: Greedy**
Try to collect all profits by buy at low and sell at high. One thing to keep in mind is that holding for bull period is the same as sell and buy back on the same day (take the profit of that day)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res, minBuy = 0, float('inf')
        for price in prices:
            # have profit now
            # we can buy at recorded min and sell
            if price-minBuy>0:
                # add to res
                res+=price-minBuy
                # set curr price as minBuy
                # so we can max our profit as if we
                # are still holding for increasing ones in the future
                minBuy = price
            else:
                # otherwise, we will hold the best we have
                # and we need to sell before we buy(no need)
                if price < minBuy:
                    # we are not making profit
                    minBuy = price
        return res
```
Further reduce and simplify our logic:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return res
```
