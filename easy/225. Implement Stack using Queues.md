## Question:

Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

-   push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
-   pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
-   top() -- Get the top element.
-   empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

**Example:**

MyStack stack = new MyStack();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);  
stack.top();   // returns 2
stack.pop();   // returns 2
stack.empty(); // returns false

**Notes:**

-   You must use  _only_  standard operations of a queue -- which means only  `push to back`,  `peek/pop from front`,  `size`, and  `is empty`  operations are valid.
-   Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
-   You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
## Solution:


**Approach 1: One Stacks**
Use a queue to add to begining, but reverse it right away. So we are managing a stack that tail is at the beginning.
```python
class MyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.list = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        """
        Push element x onto stack.
        """
        self.list = [x] + self.list
        self.reverseList()

    def pop(self) -> int:
        """
        Removes the element on top of the stack and returns that element.
        """
        return self.list.pop(0)

    def top(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the top element.
        """
        return self.list[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns whether the stack is empty.
        """
        return len(self.list)==0
    
    def reverseList(self):
        listLen = len(self.list)
        if listLen>1:
            for i in range(listLen//2-1):
                self.list[i], self.list[listLen-i] = self.list[listLen-i], self.list[i]


# Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyStack()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(n) push. O(1) pop

**SC** 
O(n) one queue as stack
