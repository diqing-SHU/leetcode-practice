## Question:


Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new  **sorted**  list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

**Input:** 1->2->4, 1->3->4
**Output:** 1->1->2->3->4->4
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Iterative with extra space**
Simple solution. Create a dummy node list for handling odd cases and result
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                cur.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                cur.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            cur = cur.next
        cur.next = l1 or l2
        return dummy.next
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**

O(n)  goes trough all nodes

**SC**

O(n) extra curr node

**Approach 2: Recursive**
If both lists are non-empty, I first make sure  `l1`  starts smaller, use its head as result, and merge the remainders behind it. Otherwise, i.e., if one or both are empty, I just return what's there.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if l1 and l2:
            if l1.val > l2.val:
	            # Swap places to start
                l1, l2 = l2, l1
            l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
        return l1 or l2
```

First make sure that  `l1`  is the "better" one (meaning  `l2`  is None or has larger/equal value). Then merge the remainders behind  `l1`.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not l1 or l2 and l1.val > l2.val:
            l1, l2 = l2, l1
        if l1:
            l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
        return l1
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) One pass

SC:O(n) Stack function calls
