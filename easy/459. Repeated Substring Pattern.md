## Question:

Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "abab"
**Output:** True
**Explanation:** It's the substring "ab" twice.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "aba"
**Output:** False

**Example 3:**

**Input:** "abcabcabcabc"
**Output:** True
**Explanation:** It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Brute Force**
Check every possible repeated string from longest to shortest. The maximum we can have is `len(s)//2` which repeated once if its valid. The minimum we can have is one char repeated for `len(s)` times.

This approach is also known as [Naive Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/)

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(s)//2,0,-1):
            if len(s)%i==0:
                # print(i)
                foundAns, j = True, 1
                while (j+1)*i <= len(s):
                    if s[:i] != s[j*i:(j+1)*i]:
                        foundAns = False
                        break
                    j+=1
                if foundAns:
                    return True
        return False
```


**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
time complexity is `O(n*sqrt(n))`, because we have no more than `O(sqrt(n))` divisors of number `n` (we can split them into pairs, where one number in pair will be `<sqrt(n)`. 

**SC** 
Space compexity is `O(n)`.

**Approach 2: Some Good Thinking**
Let us replicate our sting, remove first and last elements and try to find original string:

If the original string has a repeating sub-string, the repeating sub-string can be no larger than 1/2 the length of the original string. I.e "xyxy" would be "xy"  
By repeating the string and removing the first and last character of the new string, I.e "xyxyxyxy" => "yxyxyx", if the original string "xyxy" can be found in "y**xyxy**x", it means that "xyxy" has a repeating sub-string.

However, this solution doesn't tell us what the repeating sub-string is, but does solve the question if it exists.
```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return s in (s+s)[1:-1]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(n)  because we can find substrings in linear time. In python function `in` will work, using Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm, which is in average work in linear time


**SC** 
O(n) store duplicate string

---

**Approach 3: KMP algorithm**
The problem of the first approach is that we do not use the knowledge of failed matching, and the [Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/) is a classic example of how knowledge of failed tries can be use to guide future search.

Using KMP, `lps [i]` helps us find out the length of longest prefix that equals to the suffix in s[:i]. aka. if `lps [i] == d`, then `s[:d] == s[i-d:i]`.  
In this case, a valid `s` should be a substring `p` repeated by `k` times (`k >1`). So that `lps [n-1] == len(p) * (k-1)`. We can check this by `lps [n-1] != 0 and lps [n-1] % (n-lps [n-1]) == 0`. And necessity is easy to prove: if `lps [n-1] == len(p) * (k-1)`, `s[:(k-1)p]` == `s[p:]` then s is a `p` repeated by `k` times.
```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        lps = [0] * len(s)
        d = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            while d and s[i] != s[d]:
                d = lps[d-1]
            d += s[i] == s[d]
            lps [i] = d
        pat = lps[len(s)-1]
        return pat != 0 and (pat % (len(s)-pat) == 0)
```
Combine it with our first solution. For each possible pattern, we only need to compare whether the rest of string other than pattern matches if we put pattern at start and end. Since the rest of string should be at least one repeat of the same pattern. It also ensures that we have matching pattern at head and tail, as they are part of the remaining string.
```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedSubstringPattern(self, s: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(s)//2,0,-1):
            if len(s)%i==0:
                if s[0:len(s)-i] == s[i:]:
                    return True
        return False
```
**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) Only doing O(1) comparison in the for loop

SC:O(1) No extra space
