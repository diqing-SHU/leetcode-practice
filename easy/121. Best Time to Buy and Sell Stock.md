## Question:

Say you have an array for which the  _i_th  element is the price of a given stock on day  _i_.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: One pass**
We keep two values while looping through the array: `oneBuy` and `profit`. `oneBuy` holds the minimum buy in price and `profit` holds the maximum profit.
At everyday, we tried to sell our stock which we brought with `oneBuy` price. If it makes a higher profit, we record it. Then we take a look at today's price to see if its a good time to buy in (if it has a lower buy in price). So that we can make consideration with lowest buy in price for the rest of the days.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        oneBuy, profit = float('+inf'), 0
        for price in prices:
            profit = max(profit, price-oneBuy)
            oneBuy = min(oneBuy, price)
        return profit
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). One pass.

**SC** 
O(1) Constant space
