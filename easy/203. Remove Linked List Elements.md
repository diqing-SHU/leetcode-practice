## Question:

Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value  **_val_**.

**Example:**

**Input:**  1->2->6->3->4->5->6, _**val**_ = 6
**Output:** 1->2->3->4->5
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Iterative**
Simple solution. Just don't forget to continue when we did a remove on next. So we don't jump twice forward (next is already pointing to new node)
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: ListNode, val: int) -> ListNode:
        ans = head
        # start with second node til reaching the end
        while head and head.next:
            if head.next.val == val:
                head.next = head.next.next
                continue 
            head = head.next
        # Handles the first node
        if ans and ans.val == val:
            ans = ans.next
        return ans
```

O(n)

**Approach 2: Recursive**
Recursion is hard. Here are my thoughts:

When the input node is an empty node, then there is nothing to delete, so we just return it.

When the head of the input node is the target we want to delete, we just return head.next instead of head to skip it. , else we will return head.

We apply the same thing to every other node until it reaches None.


```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: ListNode, val: int) -> ListNode:
        # end case
        if(head == None): return head;
        # set the next with the return of recursive fucntion
        head.next = self.removeElements(head.next, val);
        # if need to delete return next node else just current node
        return head.next if head.val == val else head;
```

TC:O(n) One pass
  

SC:O(1) No space needed
