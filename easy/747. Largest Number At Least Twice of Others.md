# 747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others

## Question

You are given an integer array  `nums`  where the largest integer is  **unique**.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is  **at least twice**  as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return  _the  **index**  of the largest element, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,6,1,0]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 1 is trivially at least twice the value as any other number because there are no other numbers.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- The largest element in  `nums`  is unique.

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

We need to one pass the array while updating first and second max num, as well as the index for max num

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all elements
2. Update first and second max num, as well as the index for max num
3. Checking and return the answer

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def dominantIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums)==1:
            return 0
        maxNum, secondMaxNum, maxIndex = -1, -1, -1
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num>maxNum:
                maxNum, secondMaxNum = num, maxNum
                maxIndex = i
            elif num>secondMaxNum:
                secondMaxNum = num
        if maxNum>=2*secondMaxNum:
            return maxIndex
        return -1
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , One pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , Constant extra space
