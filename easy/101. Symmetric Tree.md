101. Symmetric Tree
Question:
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
 

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
 

Follow up: Solve it both recursively and iteratively.

Solution:
Approach 1: Recursive
A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

Therefore, the question is: when are two trees a mirror reflection of each other?

Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:

    -Their two roots have the same value.
    -The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.


```python
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def isMirror(left: TreeNode, right:TreeNode) -> bool:
                if (left == None) and (right == None):
                    return True
                if (left == None) or (right == None):
                    return False
                return (left.val == right.val) and isMirror(left.right, right.left) and isMirror(left.left, right.right)
        return isMirror(root,root)
```
