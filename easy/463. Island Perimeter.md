# 463. Island Perimeter

## Question

You are given  `row x col`  `grid`  representing a map where  `grid[i][j] = 1`  represents land and  `grid[i][j] = 0`  represents water.

Grid cells are connected  **horizontally/vertically**  (not diagonally). The  `grid`  is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/island.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1]]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0]]
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

- `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]`  is  `0`  or  `1`.
- There is exactly one island in  `grid`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: BFS

#### Intuition

BFS on every island, mark visited to avoid duplication.

#### Algorithm

1. BFS on every island
2. Mark visited to avoid duplication

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def checkIsland(row, col):
            if row not in range(m) or col not in range(n):
                return 1
            if grid[row][col] == 0:
                return 1
            if (row, col) not in visited:
                visited.add((row, col))
                return checkIsland(row+1, col) + checkIsland(row, col+1) + checkIsland(row-1, col) + checkIsland(row, col-1)
            return 0
        res, visited = 0, set()
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == 1:
                    temp = checkIsland(row, col)
                    res += temp
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  DFS all elements

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, To store visited nodes

### Approach 2: Count difference

#### Intuition

Since there are no lakes, every pair of neighbour cells with different values is part of the perimeter (more precisely, the edge between them is). So just count the differing pairs, both horizontally and vertically (for the latter I simply transpose the grid).

#### Algorithm

1. Based on the dp relation we find above, construct our dp array
2. Base case will be empty strings where we return 0

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
 def islandPerimeter(self, grid):
     return sum(sum(map(operator.ne, [0] + row, row + [0]))
                for row in grid + map(list, zip(*grid)))
```

Let me break it down for you:

Take a row:  `row = [1, 1, 0, 0]`

Prepend and append a zero:

```
[0] + row == [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
row + [0] == [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

```

Find the pairs that don't match (`operator.ne`  is the 'not equal' operator):

```
   map(operator.ne, [0] + row,       row + [0])
== map(operator.ne, [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0])
== [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

```

Count the number of pairs that don't match (this is the number of shorelines between cells in this row):

```
   sum(map(operator.ne, [0] + row, row + [0]))
== sum([1, 0, 1, 0, 0])
== 2

```

Now do this for every row and column in the grid and sum the results:

- `grid`  contains all the rows
- `map(list, zip(*grid))`  contains all the columns (`zip(*rows)`  is a trick to transpose a 2D array, but you have to do  `map(list, ...)`  as  `zip`  produces tuples rather than lists)
- `grid + map(list, zip(*grid))`  contains all the rows  _and_  all the columns

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, All nodes visited

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, To store differences
