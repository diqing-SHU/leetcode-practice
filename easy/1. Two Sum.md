# 1. Two Sum

  

## Question:
Given an array of integers, return  **indices**  of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have  **_exactly_**  one solution, and you may not use the  _same_  element twice.

**Example:**

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[**0**] + nums[**1**] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [**0**, **1**].
  

## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: HashMap**

The BF is to check the whole list again for every element in the list to find (target-num). 
TC = O(n^2)

SC = O(1)

by using dict we can reduce look up time to O(1) instead of O(n) (go through list again). 
```python
class  Solution:
    def  twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        value_dict = dict()
        for i in  range(len(nums)):
            if (target - nums[i]) in value_dict:
                return [value_dict[(target - nums[i])], i]
            else:
                value_dict[nums[i]] = i
        return []
```

**Complexity Analysis**
TC:O(n) just pass the list once while creating the dict as well as doing the O(1) check of dict.

SC:O(n)the dict
