Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


Solution: 

the BF is to check the whole list again for every element in the list to find (target-num). TC = O(n^2). SC = O(1)

by using dict we can reduce look up time to O(1) instead of O(n) (go through list again). So time complexity is O(n). just pass the list once while creating the dict as well as doing the O(1) check of dict.

Space complexity is O(n) the dict

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        value_dict = dict()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if (target - nums[i]) in value_dict:
                return [value_dict[(target - nums[i])], i]
            else:
                value_dict[nums[i]] = i
        return []
