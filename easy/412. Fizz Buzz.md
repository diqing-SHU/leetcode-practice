## Question:


Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to  _n_.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

**Example:**

n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
## Solution:


**Approach 1: One pass**
Loop through all elements and check.
```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            temp = ""
            if i%3 == 0:
                temp+="Fizz"
                if i%5 == 0:
                    temp+="Buzz"
            elif i%5 == 0:
                temp+="Buzz"
            else:
                temp+=str(i)
            res.append(temp)
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(n) put and get both O(1)

**SC** 
O(n) Res array
