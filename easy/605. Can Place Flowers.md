# 605. Can Place Flowers

## Question

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in  **adjacent**  plots.

Given an integer array  `flowerbed`  containing  `0`'s and  `1`'s, where  `0`  means empty and  `1`  means not empty, and an integer  `n`, return  _if_  `n`  new flowers can be planted in the  `flowerbed`  without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]`  is  `0`  or  `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in  `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Greedy

#### Intuition

Simply scan through the list and check if we can put flower in. If we can, we should do it.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all list and check for before and after index if we have.
2. Fill in flower as long as we can
3. Once we reach n flowers, we stop early.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0:
            return True
        if len(flowerbed) == 1:
            if flowerbed[0] == 0:
                return n == 1
        for i, plot in enumerate(flowerbed):
            if plot == 0:
                if i == 0:
                    if flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
                        flowerbed[i] = 1
                        n-=1
                elif i == len(flowerbed)-1:
                    if flowerbed[i-1] == 0:
                        flowerbed[i] = 1
                        n-=1
                else:
                    if flowerbed[i-1] == 0 and flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
                        flowerbed[i] = 1
                        n-=1
            if n == 0:
                return True
        return False
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` One pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` Constant space
