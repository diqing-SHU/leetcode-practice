# 234. Palindrome Linked List

  

## Question:



Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1->2
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 1->2->2->1
**Output:** true

**Follow up:**  
Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
## Solution:

**Approach 1: List**
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        nodeList = []
        while head:
            nodeList.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        halfLen = len(nodeList)//2
        print(halfLen)
        for i in range(0, halfLen):
            if nodeList[i] != nodeList[len(nodeList)-1-i]:
                return False
        return True
```
**Complexity Analysis**
TC = O(n)
SC = O(n)

**Approach 2: 2 pointer**
fast travels 2x the speed of the slow.

when fast reach the end, the slow will be at the mid point(odd number) or 1 pass mid point(even number)

therefore, we can revese the rest of slow pointer and put fast pointer to the start.

then we travel together until the slow reaches the end (mid point for odd numbers, -1 mid point for even numbers)


Split and Reverse and Compare

First split the list into two halves. Use slow and fast pointer trick.

Be careful to handle odd number list. Split such that the larger list is second list.

Use a variable skip which indicates if first element has to be skipped or not - i.e. there are odd number of elements and first element of second list would be the center of the palindrome.


Reverse the first half of the list. Then compare it node by node with second half. Use skip variable to compare odd numbered lists correctly.

Use tail pointer to join - read the code.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, root):
        prev, cur = None, root
        while cur:
            temp, cur.next = cur.next, prev
            prev, cur = cur, temp
        return prev
    
    def split(self, head):
        if head == None:
            return None, False
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        if fast:
            fast = fast.next
        while True:
            if fast == None or fast.next == None:
                root, slow.next = slow.next, None
                return root, (fast!=None)
            else:
                slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next
                if fast:
                    fast = fast.next
        return

    def compare(self, l1, l2):
        while l1 is not None and l2 is not None:
            if l1.val != l2.val:
                return False
            l1, l2 = l1.next, l2.next
        return l1 is None and l2 is None
            

    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if head == None or head.next == None:
            return True
        root, skip = self.split(head)
        head = self.reverse(head)
        tail = head
        answer = self.compare(head, root.next) if skip else self.compare(head, root)
        head = self.reverse(head)
        tail.next = root
        return answer
```
**Complexity Analysis**
TC = O(n)
SC = O(n/2) => o(n)
