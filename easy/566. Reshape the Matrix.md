# 566. Reshape the Matrix

## Question

In MATLAB, there is a handy function called  `reshape` which can reshape an  `m x n`  matrix into a new one with a different size  `r x c` keeping its original data.

You are given an  `m x n` matrix  `mat`  and two integers  `r`  and  `c`  representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the  `reshape` operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
**Output:** [[1,2,3,4]]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/reshape2-grid.jpg)

**Input:** mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-1000 <= mat[i][j] <= 1000`
- `1 <= r, c <= 300`

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

Just build a matrix with different m, n

#### Algorithm

1. Check if size is the same
2. If so, one pass and build

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def matrixReshape(self, mat: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(mat)*len(mat[0]) != r*c:
            return mat
        res, currRow = [], []
        for row in mat:
            for value in row:
                currRow.append(value)
                if len(currRow) == c:
                    res.append(currRow)
                    currRow = []
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), one pass
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), res 2d array
