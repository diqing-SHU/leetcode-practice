Some useful Itertool functions:

`itertools.accumulate()`: information is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate). It's accumulate sum and return that array of accumulated sum

`itertools.combinations`: information is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations). It generates combinations of that size and return the array. Combinations are sorted from small to large
