Half way through [Leetcode Binary Tree card questions](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/133/conclusion/). Its very helpful.

I decided to finish all the cards before moving on to random question in the future.

Notes will be taken for each of the topics for reviewing and referencing just in case.
