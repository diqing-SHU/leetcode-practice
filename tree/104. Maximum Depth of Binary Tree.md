## Question:

  
  
  


Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree  `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its depth = 3.
  

## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Bottom-up Recursion**

depth of a node is the (max between the depth of left child and depth of right child) + 1. 
When we reach None, it has 0 depth and goes bottom up.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        return max(self.maxDepth(root.left)+1,self.maxDepth(root.right)+1)
```

  

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) The time complexity is O(n) because the recursive function is T(n)=2â‹…T(n/2)+1.

  

SC:O(n) The worst case space required is O(n), and in the average case it's O(logn) where n is number of nodes.

**Approach 2: Top-down**

Use a stack LIFO to do BFS and counting levels.
Not much

```python

def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        tstack,h = [root],0
        #count number of levels
        while tstack:
            nextlevel = []
            while tstack:
                top = tstack.pop()
                if top.left:
                    nextlevel.append(top.left)
                if top.right:
                    nextlevel.append(top.right)
            tstack = nextlevel
            h+=1
        return h
```
