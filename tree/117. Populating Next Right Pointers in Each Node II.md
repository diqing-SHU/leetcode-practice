## Question:

  

Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to  `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to  `NULL`.

**Follow up:**

-   You may only use constant extra space.
-   Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
**Output:** [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
**Explanation:** Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the given tree is less than  `6000`.
-   `-100 <= node.val <= 100`
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Recursion**

Use dfs with level parameter to inorderly traverse the tree right to left. Keep tracks of previous node in the same level to set as the next of current one.
Same solution as **Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node I**

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        def dfs(node, level, res):
            if node:
                if len(res)<=level:
                    res.append(node)
                else:
                    node.next = res[level]
                    res[level] = node
                dfs(node.right,level+1, res)
                dfs(node.left,level+1, res)
        res = []
        dfs(root, 0, res)
        return root
```

  

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) goes through every node

  

SC:O(n) res array size changes

**Approach 2: BTS**
Just BTS the tree left to right.

Level by level traversal with a dummy head prekid.

root: is for the current level;
prekid: The dummy head;
prekid.next: let dummy head's next store the first node of the child level for us;
kid: is for the child level traversal, to connect each node in child level while moving ahead.

When this level's work are all done, we move to next level by: 
root = prekid.next   # Just the child level's head
kid = prekid         # We use this dummy head for the new level's traversal.
kid.next = None      # Let the dummy head's next be None, before we going for this new level.

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        old_root = root
        prekid = Node(0)
        kid = prekid   # Let kid point to prekid 
        while root:
	        # moving in level
            while root:
                if root.left:
                    kid.next = root.left
                    kid = kid.next
                if root.right:
                    kid.next = root.right
                    kid = kid.next
                root = root.next
            # move down a level
            root, kid = prekid.next, prekid
            kid.next = None  # Reset the chain for prekid
        return old_root
```
