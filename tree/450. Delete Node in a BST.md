## Question:


Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1.  Search for a node to remove.
2.  If the node is found, delete the node.

**Note:**  Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

**Example:**

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Recursive**
Recursively call this function, what we are doing is:
Once we found the right node, we replace it with most right of left tree. Then we delete most right from the left tree.
In general, this function try to delete the target node for current node, and return the results afterwards.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
		if not root:
            return
        
        # we always want to delete the node when it is the root of a subtree,
        # so we handle left or right according to the val.
        # if the node does not exist, we will hit the very first if statement and return None.
        if key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
            
        elif key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        
        # now the key is the root of a subtree
        else:
            # if the subtree does not have a left child, we just return its right child
            # to its father, and they will be connected on the higher level recursion.
            if not root.left:
                return root.right
            
            # if it has a left child, we want to find the max val on the left subtree to 
            # replace the node we want to delete.
            else:
                # try to find the max value on the left subtree
                tmp = root.left
                while tmp.right:
                    tmp = tmp.right
                    
                # replace
                root.val = tmp.val
                
                # since we have replaced the node we want to delete with the tmp, now we don't
                # want to keep the tmp on this tree, so we just use our function to delete it.
                # pass the val of tmp to the left subtree and repeat the whole approach.
                root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, tmp.val)
        # This will return the root of original tree
        return root
```
It will be easier if we consider some tree and try to understand, what we need to do in different cases.

0.  First we need to find our node in tree, so we just traverse it until  `root.val == key`.
1.  Case 1: node do not have any children, like  `1`,  `8`,  `11`,  `14`,  `6`  or  `18`: then we just delete it and nothing else to do here.
2.  Case 2: node has left children, but do not have right, for example  `3`  or  `20`. In this case we can just delete this node and put connection betweeen its parent and its children: for example for  `3`, we put connection  `5->1`  and for  `20`  we put connection  `17->18`. Note, that the property of BST will be fulfilled, because for parent all left subtree will be less than its value and nothing will change for others nodes.
3.  Case 3: node has right children, but do not have left, for example  `13`  and  `17`. This case is almost like case  `2`: we just can delete node and reconnect its parent with its children.
4.  Case 4: node has both children, like  `12`,  `5`,  `7`,  `9`  or  `15`. In this case we can not just delete it. Let us consider node  `5`. We want to find succesor of this node: the node with next value, to do this we need to go one time to the right and then as left as possible. For node  `5`  our succesor will be  `6`: we go  `5->7->6`. How we can delete node  `5`  now? We swap nodes  `5`  and  `6`  (or just put value  `6`  to  `5`) and then we need to deal with new tree, where we need to delete node which I put in square. How to do it? Just understand, that this node do not have left children, so it is either Case 1 or Case 3, which we already can solve.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, root, key):
        if not root: return None
        
        if root.val == key:
            if not root.right: return root.left
            
            if not root.left: return root.right
            
            if root.left and root.right:
                temp = root.right
                while temp.left: temp = temp.left
                root.val = temp.val
                root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, root.val)

        elif root.val > key:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        else:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
            
        return root
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**Complexity**: Complexity of finding node is  `O(h)`, Cases 1,2,3 is  `O(1)`. Complexity of Case  `4`  is  `O(h)`  as well, because we first find succesor and then apply one of the Cases 1,3 only once. So, overall complexity is  `O(h)`. Space complexity is  `O(h)`  as well, because we use recursion and potentially we can find our node in the bottom of tree.
