# 101. Symmetric Tree

  

## Question:


Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree  `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]`  is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following  `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`  is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

**Follow up:**  Solve it both recursively and iteratively.
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Recursive**
A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

  

Therefore, the question is: when are two trees a mirror reflection of each other?

  

Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:

  

-Their two roots have the same value.

-The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.
```python
def  isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    def  isMirror(left: TreeNode, right:TreeNode) -> bool:
        if (left == None) and (right == None):
            return  True
        if (left == None) or (right == None):
            return  False
        return (left.val == right.val) and isMirror(left.right, right.left) and isMirror(left.left, right.right)
    return isMirror(root,root)
```
My approach. At any point we found a false just return it and end the stack
```python
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def isMirror(node1, node2):
            if (node1 and not node2) or (node2 and not node1):
                return False
            elif node1 and node2:
                if node1.val != node2.val:
                    return False
                else:
                    return isMirror(node1.left, node2.right) and isMirror(node1.right, node2.left)
            else:
                return True
        if root:
            return isMirror(root.left, root.right)
        else:
            return True
```
