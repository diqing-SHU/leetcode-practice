# 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

  

## Question:


Given an  `m x n`  integers  `matrix`, return  _the length of the longest increasing path in_ `matrix`.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You  **may not**  move  **diagonally**  or move  **outside the boundary**  (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/27/tmp-grid.jpg)

**Input:** matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest increasing path is `[3, 4, 5, 6]`. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1]]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

-   `m == matrix.length`
-   `n == matrix[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
-   `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231  - 1`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: DFS/DP**

We can use DFS to explore the increasing path starting from one position. To trade time with space, we can add in memorization. We can store the max we explored starting from one position into corresponding position in DP array. So that later, if we explored back to this position, we don't need to re-travel from here.

We will not be visiting visited nodes as we only keep moving if the value in next position is higher(lower) than current position.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # try dp through the matrix to get ans
        dp, res = {}, 0
        def checkValid(row, col):
            if 0<=row<len(matrix) and 0<=col<len(matrix[0]):
                return True
            return False
        
        def findMax(row, col):
            if checkValid(row, col):
                if (row, col) in dp:
	                # we know the max starting from here
                    return dp[(row, col)]
                else:
	                # start with 0, since we haven't increase our count
                    currMax = 0
                    # check if next position exists and if its in increase order
                    # and bring the max back if true
                    if checkValid(row-1, col) and matrix[row-1][col] > matrix[row][col]:
                        currMax = max(currMax, findMax(row-1, col))
                    if checkValid(row+1, col) and matrix[row+1][col] > matrix[row][col]:
                        currMax = max(currMax, findMax(row+1, col))
                    if checkValid(row, col-1) and matrix[row][col-1] > matrix[row][col]:
                        currMax = max(currMax, findMax(row, col-1))
                    if checkValid(row, col+1) and matrix[row][col+1] > matrix[row][col]:
                        currMax = max(currMax, findMax(row, col+1))
                    # add 1 to increase count for current position
                    currMax+=1
                    # store to avoid redundant calculations
                    dp[(row, col)] = currMax
                    return currMax
            return 0
                    
        for row in range(len(matrix)):
            for col in range(len(matrix[0])):
                currPos, currMax = (row, col), 0
                currMax = findMax(row, col)
                res = max(res, currMax)
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**


TC:O(n) will visited every node

SC:O(n) Need to store the max in progress
