# 850. Rectangle Area II

## Question

We are given a list of (axis-aligned)  `rectangles`. Each  `rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2]` , where  `(xi1, yi1)`  are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and  `(xi2, yi2)`  are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the  `ith`  rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all  `rectangles`  in the plane. Since the answer may be too large, return it  **modulo**  `109  + 7`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/06/rectangle_area_ii_pic.png)

**Input:** rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** As illustrated in the picture.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The answer is 1018 modulo (109 + 7), which is (109)2 = (-7)2 = 49.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rectangles.length <= 200`
- `rectanges[i].length = 4`
- `0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 109`
- The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed  `263  - 1`  and thus will fit in a  **64-bit**  signed integer.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Line Sweep

#### Intuition

The main idea is to sweep through x axis, and using open intervals of y axis to calculate the space up to the sweep x values.

We also sweep through open intervals to make sure not to double count.

#### Algorithm

1. Get the events that we need to do calculation and update open intervals
2. For each event, realize space and update (and sort if needed) open interval
3. Return the total realized area at the end of events

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        INT_MIN = -2**32
        # convert list of rectangles to events
        events = [] # tuple of x, isOpen, y1, y2
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            events.append((x1, True, y1, y2))
            events.append((x2, False, y1, y2))
        events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0]))
        # helper to do total interval via sweep
        def gain_area(xMoved):
            area = 0
            prev = INT_MIN
            for l, r in open_intervals:
                # dont update prev if we already
                # counted to a prev larger than l
                prev = max(prev, l)
                # ignore negative area which is
                # the part we already counted
                area += max(0, (r - prev) * xMoved)
                # move to the end of current interval
                prev = max(r, prev)
            return area
            
        # sweep line to realize area
        area = 0
        prev = INT_MIN
        open_intervals = []
        for event in events:
            curr, isOpen, y1, y2 = event
            area += gain_area(curr - prev)
            if isOpen:
                open_intervals.append((y1, y2))
                open_intervals.sort()
            else:
                open_intervals.remove((y1, y2))
            prev = curr
        return area%MOD
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n^2logn)`,
  - `O(n)`, to loop through events
  - `O(nlogn)`, to sort open intervals as the most expensive operation in loop

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, to store all visited nodes in hashmap

### Approach 3: Improved interval merge

#### Intuition

Actually, we can do our interval merge in  `O(n)`  time instead of  `O(n^2)`. First, let us create all unique  `y`  coordinates: set  `ys`, then we create correspondences between indexes and these  `y`  coordinates: this is  `y_i`  dictionary. Finally,  `count`  will be count: how many times each segment is covered. We again create sides like in previous approach.

Next, we again iterate through our sides and update area, but now when we meet new segment, we update  `count`} for range:  `+1`  for start of rectangle and  `-1`  for end of rectangle. Finally, we update our  `cur_y_sum`: we check if count is  `0`  and if it is more than  `0`, we add length of this segment to  `cur_y_sum`.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles):
        ys = sorted(set([y for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles for y in [y1, y2]]))
        y_i = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(ys)}
        count = [0] * len(y_i)
        
        sides_lft = [(x1,-1,y1,y2) for x1,y1,x2,y2 in rectangles]
        sides_rgh = [(x2,1,y1,y2) for x1,y1,x2,y2 in rectangles]
        sides = sorted(sides_lft + sides_rgh)
         
        cur_x = cur_y_sum = area = 0
        for x, op_cl, y1, y2 in sides:
            area += (x - cur_x) * cur_y_sum
            cur_x = x
            for i in range(y_i[y1], y_i[y2]):
                count[i] += op_cl
            cur_y_sum = sum(y2 - y1 if c else 0 for y1, y2, c in zip(ys, ys[1:], count))
        return area % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n^2)`, all nodes are visited

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, space is the tree height this time

### Approach 4: Segment trees

#### Intuition

There is also `O(n log n)` solution, using segment trees. The idea is to use segment tree where we need to deal only with updates of ranges. If we need only range update, and not queries, not need to do lazy updates - see [https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html), (**Addition on segments**) chapter. Also we need to need to keep `self.total` dictionary, which for each segment will calculate length of all active segments we have so far.

#### Algorithm

1. Construct segment trees
2. Update segment tree as we sweep through events

#### Code

```python
class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, xs):
        self.cnts = defaultdict(int)
        self.total = defaultdict(int)
        self.xs = xs

    def update(self, v, tl, tr, l, r, h):
        if l > r: return
        if l == tl and r == tr:
            self.cnts[v] += h
        else:
            tm = (tl + tr)//2
            self.update(v*2, tl, tm, l, min(r, tm), h)
            self.update(v*2+1, tm+1, tr, max(l, tm+1), r, h)
          
        if self.cnts[v] > 0:
            self.total[v] = self.xs[tr + 1] - self.xs[tl]
        else:
            self.total[v] = self.total[v*2] + self.total[v*2+1]
        return self.total[v]
    
class Solution:
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles):
        xs = sorted(set([x for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles for x in [x1, x2]]))
        xs_i = {x:i for i, x in enumerate(xs)}

        STree = SegmentTree(xs)
        L = []
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            L.append([y1, 1, x1, x2])
            L.append([y2, -1, x1, x2])
        L.sort()

        cur_y = cur_x_sum = area = 0
        
        for y, op_cl, x1, x2 in L:
            area += (y - cur_y) * cur_x_sum
            cur_y = y
            STree.update(1, 0,  len(xs) - 1, xs_i[x1], xs_i[x2]-1, op_cl)
            cur_x_sum = STree.total[1]
            
        return area % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(nlogn)`, time to construct segment tree

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all range will be stored
