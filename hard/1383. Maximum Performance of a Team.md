# 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

  

## Question
You are given two integers  `n`  and  `k`  and two integer arrays  `speed`  and  `efficiency`  both of length  `n`. There are  `n`  engineers numbered from  `1`  to  `n`.  `speed[i]`  and  `efficiency[i]`  represent the speed and efficiency of the  `ith`  engineer respectively.

Choose  **at most**  `k`  different engineers out of the  `n`  engineers to form a team with the maximum  **performance**.

The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.

Return  _the maximum performance of this team_. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it  **modulo**  `109  + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
**Output:** 60
**Explanation:** 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
**Output:** 68
**Explanation:** This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
**Output:** 72

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= <= k <= n <= 105`
-   `speed.length == n`
-   `efficiency.length == n`
-   `1 <= speed[i] <= 105`
-   `1 <= efficiency[i] <= 108`
## Solution

  

### Approach 1: Heap

#### Intuition
We can simply sort the workers if we will just pick one. Which means we can use the efficiency of that worker to sort.

However, things get tricky when we try to pick k workers since the efficiency is actually the minimum value among them. In other word, we can't avoid calculate all combinations.

To make use of previous picked k workers, we will need to make sure some of the condition will stay the same. If we loop through all workers in sorted order. We can make sure that `currEff` is always smaller or equal to all previous ones (including those picked). Then, our ans will only based on sum of picked workers. For that, we can keep a heap to store picked ones. When we are trying a new worker, we pop out least performant one and push the new one into the heap.

#### Algorithm
1. Sort our workers
2. One pass all workers to calculate all best combinations
3. return the maximum of them

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int: 
        # sort our workers based on efficiency and speed (fast to slow)
        efficiencyWithSpeed = []
        for i in range(n):
            efficiencyWithSpeed.append((efficiency[i], speed[i]))
        efficiencyWithSpeed.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], -x[1]))
        sm, ans, heap = 0, 0, []
        # our total efficiency = sum of speed * min eff
        # by going through all workers, we have all combinations with length k
        for currEff, currSpeed in efficiencyWithSpeed:
            # based on greedy, remove least performance worker
            # if we exceed our limit k (k-1 here, since we will
            # be pushing current one in later before calculation)
            if len(heap) > k - 1: sm -= heappop(heap)
            # push in current one
            heappush(heap, currSpeed)
            sm += currSpeed
            # calculate and update ans
            ans = max(ans, sm*currEff)
        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
```
`zip` can really make it clean!
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int: 
        sm, ans, heap = 0, 0, []
        
        for currEff, currSpeed in sorted(zip(efficiency, speed))[::-1]:
            if len(heap) > k - 1: sm -= heappop(heap)
            heappush(heap, currSpeed )
            sm += currSpeed 
            ans = max(ans, sm*currEff)
        
        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + n log k), 
	- sort takes O(nlogn)
	- heap insert takes O(logk) but its with a loop, so total O(nlogk)
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n+k), sorted list and our heap
