# 827. Making A Large Island

## Question

You are given an  `n x n`  binary matrix  `grid`. You are allowed to change  **at most one**  `0`  to be  `1`.

Return  _the size of the largest  **island**  in_  `grid`  _after applying this operation_.

An  **island**  is a 4-directionally connected group of  `1`s.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `grid[i][j]`  is either  `0`  or  `1`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: DFS

#### Intuition

Since we want to get the max size of island if we can mark one water (0) as land(1). In the end, we just need to check all water(0) slots and see how large the island will be if we mark it as land.

To avoid re-DFS visited islands, we should store the size of different islands. And to differentiate them, we should assign different ids to them.

To make the checking easier, we can also update the value in the 2d array to the id of the island. So that we can look up the size of an island with the id in 2d array.

#### Algorithm

1. DFS all lands, mark them with different island id
2. Update count in map corresponding to island id while DFS
3. Loop through all waters, check the size of island if we mark that water slot as land (1 + size of unique islands next to it)
4. Also compare with the max island without filling any water since it might be larger

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def largestIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # check if position is valid
        def isValid(row, col):
            return 0 <= row < m and 0 <= col < n
        # add count and mark island with id
        def dfs(currId, row, col):
            if not isValid(row, col):
                return
            if grid[row][col] == 1:
                islandMap[currId] += 1
                grid[row][col] = currId
                dfs(currId, row+1, col)
                dfs(currId, row, col+1)
                dfs(currId, row-1, col)
                dfs(currId, row, col-1)
        # dfs all islands and mark them with different id while store count in hashmap
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islandMap, currId = {}, 2
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == 1:
                    islandMap[currId] = 0
                    dfs(currId, row, col)
                    currId+=1
        # island with id 0 is empty space(0)
        islandMap[0] = 0
        # init ans with the largest island
        res = max(islandMap.values())
        # check for each empty space
        # try to mark it as island
        # and calculate max space for
        # all islands connected with it
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == 0:
                    neibIdSet = set()
                    if isValid(row+1, col):
                        neibIdSet.add(grid[row+1][col])
                    if isValid(row, col+1):
                        neibIdSet.add(grid[row][col+1])
                    if isValid(row-1, col):
                        neibIdSet.add(grid[row-1][col])
                    if isValid(row, col-1):
                        neibIdSet.add(grid[row][col-1])
                    res = max(res, sum(islandMap[islandId] for islandId in neibIdSet) + 1)
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n^2)`, All element can be visited once in a loop (n is the grid length)

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n^2)`, hashmap of islands
