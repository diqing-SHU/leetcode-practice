# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

## Question

You are given an array  `prices`  where  `prices[i]`  is the price of a given stock on the  `ith`  day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete  **at most two transactions**.

**Note:**  You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** prices = [1]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

## Solution

### Approach 1: DP

#### Intuition

My way to solve this problem is to first evaluate matrix  `B`  of differences and then what is asked is to find the maximum sum of  **two(k)**  contiguous subarrays. We can also make optimization  `if k > len(prices)//2: return sum(x for x in B if x > 0)`, which will help us, if  `k`  is big (in this problem it is equal to  `2`, so you can remove this line, but you need it for problem 188). If  `k`  is more than half of length of  `prices`, we can just choose all positive elements, we will have enough transactions to do it.

Let us create  `dp`  array with size  `k+1`  by  `n-1`, where  `dp[i][j]`  is the maximum gain, where already made  `j`  transactions, that is choose  `j`  contiguous subarrays and used all elements before our equal number  `i`. Also,  `mp[i][j] = max(dp[0][j], ..., dp[i][j])`. We take  `k+1`  size, because we start with  `0`  transactions, which will be filled with zeros. We take  `n-1`  size, because original size is  `n`, and size of differences is  `n-1`. Also we start with  `dp[0][1] = B[0]`, because we need to choose one contiguous subarray which ends with element  `B[0]`, which is  `B[0]`  itself. Also we put  `mp[0][1] = B[0]`  for the same logic.

#### Algorithm

we iterate over all  `i`  from  `1`  to  `n-2`  inclusive and  `j`  from  `1`  to  `k`  inclusive and:

1. Update  `dp[i][j] = max(mp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]) + B[i]`. By definition we need to take  `B[i]`. We can either say, that we add it to the last contiguous subarray:  `dp[i-1][j] + B[i]`, or we say that it is new contiguous subarray:  `mp[i-1][j-1] + B[i]`. Note, here we use  `mp`, because we actually have  `max(dp[0][j-1], ... , dp[i-1][j-1])`.
2. Update  `mp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], mp[i-1][j])`.
3. Finally, return maximum from the  `mp[-1]`, we need to choose maximum, because optimal solution can be with less than  `k`  transactions.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        if len(prices) <= 1: return 0
        n, k = len(prices), 2

        B = [prices[i+1] - prices[i] for i in range(len(prices) - 1)]
        if k > len(prices)//2: return sum(x for x in B if x > 0)
        
        dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n-1)] 
        mp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n-1)] 

        dp[0][1], mp[0][1] = B[0], B[0]

        for i in range(1, n-1):
            for j in range(1, k+1):
                dp[i][j] = max(mp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]) + B[i]
                mp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], mp[i-1][j])

        return max(mp[-1])
```

**Optimization:**

Note, that if we have array like  `[1,5,7, -7, -4, -3, 10, 2, 7, -4, -8, 13, 15]`, then we can work in fact with smaller array  `[1+5+7, -7-4-3, 10+2+7, -4-8, 13+15] = [13,-14,19,-12,28]`. So, instead of  `B = [prices[i+1] - prices[i] for i in range(len(prices) - 1)]`, we can evaluate:

```python
delta = [prices[i+1]-prices[i] for i in range (len(prices)-1)]
B=[sum(delta) for _, delta in groupby(delta, key=lambda x: x < 0)]
n, k = len(B) + 1, 2
```

When used this code, I have  `132ms`  to  `64`ms improvement (which is faster than 99%).  

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  `O(nk) = O(n)`, because here `k = 2`

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, The same as time: `O(nk) = O(n)`

### Approach 2: One pass

#### Intuition

Is this greedy? I think it is. The solution is based on the fact that we have to sell first before we buy another. In other word, we just need to check 3 scenarios:

- No buy no sell (always 0)
- One buy one sell
- Two buy two sell

Some nice comment to help understand:

This is DP with optimization on space!

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all prices
2. Keep track of max earn for `oneBuyOneSell` and `twoBuyTwoSell`
3. Return max of the two

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        oneBuy, twoBuy, oneBuyOneSell, twoBuyTwoSell = float('-inf'), float('-inf'), 0, 0
        for price in prices:
            # maximum profit for twoBuy till today
            twoBuyTwoSell = max(twoBuyTwoSell, twoBuy+price)
            # minium money to do twoBuy till today (we have to sell oneBuy first, using maximum profit til yesterday)
            twoBuy    = max(twoBuy, oneBuyOneSell-price)
            # maximum profit for oneBuy till today
            oneBuyOneSell = max(oneBuyOneSell, oneBuy+price)
            # minium money to do oneBuy till today
            oneBuy   = max(oneBuy, -price)
        # twoBuyTwoSell hold same value as oneBuyOneSell if we only did oneBuyOneSell
        # but we write this way to show hte logic
        return max(oneBuyOneSell, twoBuyTwoSell)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, One pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, Constant extra space
