## Question:


You are given a  `grid`  of size  `N x N`, and each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially  **turned off**.

You are also given an array of lamp positions  `lamps`, where  `lamps[i] = [rowi, coli]`  indicates that the lamp at  `grid[rowi][coli]`  is  **turned on**. When a lamp is turned on, it  **illuminates its cell**  and  **all other cells**  in the same  **row, column, or diagonal**.

Finally, you are given a query array  `queries`, where `queries[i] = [rowi, coli]`. For the  `ith` query, determine whether  `grid[rowi][coli]`  is illuminated or not. After answering the  `ith`  query, **turn off**  the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]`  and its  **8 adjacent lamps**  if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with `grid[rowi][coli]`.

Return  _an array of integers_ `ans`_,_ _where_ `ans[i]` _should be_ `1` _if the lamp in the_ `ith` _query was illuminated, or_ `0` _if the lamp was not._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
**Output:** [1,0]
**Explanation:** We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].
The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,1]]
**Output:** [1,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[0,4]], queries = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,4]]
**Output:** [1,1,0]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= N <= 109`
-   `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
-   `lamps[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= lamps[i][j] < N`
-   `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
-   `queries[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= queries[i][j] < N`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Brute force with knowledge from N-Queen**
We know that location with the same `x-y` and `x+y` are on obliques from N-queens. Thus, we can check if a pointer is illuminated with that. We can also create a function to check if a point with in "turn-off" range is in lamps.

Turns out too slow. It takes O(n) for `checkIlluminated`. And, in `turnOff`, it takes O(n^2^) if not using dictionary and still O(n) even with dictionary improvement. Since we also loop `queries`, it takes O(n^2^) to O(n^3^)

```python
class Solution:
    def gridIllumination(self, N: int, lamps: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
		lampsDict = {tuple(lamps[i]): 1 for i in range(len(lamps))}
        def checkIlluminated(location):
            for x,y in lampsDict:
                if x-y == location[0]-location[1] or x+y == location[0]+location[1] or x == location[0] or y == location[1]:
                    return 1
            return 0
        
        def turnOff(location):
            res = checkIlluminated(location)
            for x in range(location[0]-1,location[0]+2):
                for y in range(location[1]-1,location[1]+2):
                    if (0<=x and x<=N) and (0<=y and y<=N):
                        if (x,y) in lampsDict:
                            del lampsDict[(x,y)]
            return res
            
        ans = []
        for query in queries:
            ans.append(turnOff(query))
        return ans
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n^2^) to O(n^3^)  Turns out too slow

**SC** 
O(1) to O(n) No extra space

**Approach 2: Counters for all illuminated situations**
Like N-Queens, a location is illuminated if a light is in its horizontal, vertical or oblique. Since we can use x, y , x-y, x+y to represent each of the situation. 

We can one pass the lamps to create our counter collections.
As long as any of the counter on corresponding index is greater than 0 (at least one light), its still illuminated. 
Then, we just need to remove light and reduce corresponding counter as we go through the queries.

```python
class Solution:
    def gridIllumination(self, N: int, lamps: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
	    # Convert 2d array to array of tuples(constant that we can use to hash)
        lamps = list(map(tuple, lamps))    # apply for python3
        # Convert to set to utlize O(1) search and delete
        light_set = set(lamps)
        # one cell may be illuminated by many lamps
        horizontal = Counter()
        vertical = Counter()
        l_oblique = Counter()
        r_oblique = Counter()
        for x, y in lamps:
            horizontal[x] += 1
            vertical[y] += 1
            l_oblique[x+y] += 1
            r_oblique[y-x] += 1
        
        res = []
        for x,y in queries:
	        # Check with our counters
            if x in horizontal or y in vertical or x+y in l_oblique or y-x in r_oblique:
                res.append(1)
            else:
                res.append(0)
            for dx,dy in [[-1,-1], [-1,0], [-1,1], [0,-1], [0,0], [0,1], [1,-1], [1,0], [1,1]]:
                xpos, ypos = x + dx, y + dy
                if (xpos, ypos) in light_set:
	                # Remove light
                    light_set.remove((xpos, ypos))
	                # Reduce counter for removing that light
                    horizontal[xpos] -= 1
                    if horizontal[xpos] == 0: del horizontal[xpos]
                    
                    vertical[ypos] -= 1
                    if vertical[ypos] == 0: del vertical[ypos]
                    
                    l_oblique[xpos+ypos] -= 1
                    if l_oblique[xpos+ypos] == 0: del l_oblique[xpos+ypos]
                        
                    r_oblique[ypos-xpos] -= 1
                    if r_oblique[ypos-xpos] == 0: del r_oblique[ypos-xpos]
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) Convert to set, create counters, and looping through queries are all O(n) operations. And searching and removing in set all takes O(1)

**SC** 
O(n) The converted set, 4 counters are all O(n) spaced
