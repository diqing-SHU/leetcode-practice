## Question:

Given a string containing just the characters  `'('`  and  `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "(()"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = ")()())"
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = ""
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `s[i]`  is  `'('`, or  `')'`.

## Solution:

**Approach 1: DP**

This is a perfect DP question as we can get max substring at one position based on previous informations. We also know that  we can only get substrings at `)` which closes open parentheses.
The hardest part will be getting the dp relation. And we have 2 relations:

 1. Previous char is `(`: We just closed one pair, we can extend the length at `i-2` by 2. Thus, `dp[i]=dp[i−2]+2`
 2. Previous char is `)`: Its possible we close another pair, but the opening `(`will be at 1 position before the index of last max substring starting point (`i−dp[i−1]−1`). Thus, `dp[i]=dp[i−1]+2+dp[i−dp[i−1]−2]` if char at`i−dp[i−1]−1`is a `(`. Don't forget to add `dp[i−dp[i−1]−2]`as we extend the max substring from there too. Of course only if its valid.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        # handle corner case
        if len(s) == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [0]*len(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # for case of "(", our dp initalized with 0
            # if we found a ")"
            if s[i] == ")":
                # make sure we have prev char
                if i-1 >= 0:
                    # check prev char
                    if s[i-1] == "(":
                        # we just closed one pair of Parentheses
                        # add 2 to max length we have at i-2
                        dp[i]=dp[i-2]+2
                    else:
                        # last one is ")", its possible we closed an opening before previous paris
                        # (i - dp[i - 1]) is the starting point of paris we have at i-1
                        # check if (i - dp[i - 1] - 1) is a "(", if so we can close it
                        if i - dp[i-1] > 0 and s[i - dp[i-1] - 1] == '(':
                            # close one add 2 to the length
                            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 2
                            # check if we have index before the new starting point (i − dp[i−1] − 1)
                            if i - dp[i-1] - 2 >= 0:
                                # dont forget to add the max substring we have before that position
                                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i-dp[i-1]-2] + 2
        print(dp)
        return max(dp)
```

**Approach 2: Stack**
We can easily validate parentheses with stack. To keep track of the length, we just need to store index in stack. As currLength = index  of `)` - index of `( it closes` + 1 =  index  of `)` - ( index of `( it closes` - 1).
Since currently in stack we only have index of `(`s, we need to store starting points into stack in case all `(`is matched cases. And we store new starting point in if invalid case happens (we have a `)`that doesn't match any `(`

```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        # -1 at starting point
        res, stack = 0, [-1]
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if (char == '('):
                # push the new open parenthese index in 
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                # match one parenthese, pop the matched one (could be starting point)
                stack.pop()
                # no thing left in stack, even starting point
                if len(stack)==0:
                    # we push current index in as new starting point
                    # since its a new start for max substrings
                    stack.append(i)
                else:
                    # get current max length by 
                    # i - last open parenthese after pop (index-1) or starting point
                    res = max(res, i - stack[-1])
        return res
```

**Approach 3: 2 pass**
Think about our question as finding max length valid parentheses that starts at any point and ends at any point.
The scan from left to right finds the max length valid parentheses that starts at any point
The scan from right to left  finds the max length valid parentheses that ends at any point
The max between this two will be our ans

  

```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, left, right = 0, 0, 0
        # left-to-right scan, right > left means invalid
        # reset our counter, and count the rest
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                left+=1
            else:
                right+=1
            if left == right:
                # find a substring
                res = max(res, 2*right)
            elif right > left:
                # invalid case happened, reset opur counts
                left = right = 0
        left = right = 0
        # right-to-left scan, left > right means invalid
        # reset our counter, and count the rest
        for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1):
            if s[i] == '(':
                left+=1
            else:
                right+=1
            if left == right:
                res = max(res, 2*right)
            elif left > right:
                # invalid case happened, reset opur counts
                left = right = 0
        return res
            
```
