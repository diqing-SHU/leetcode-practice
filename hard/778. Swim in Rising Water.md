# 778. Swim in Rising Water

## Question


On an N x N  `grid`, each square  `grid[i][j]`  represents the elevation at that point  `(i,j)`.

Now rain starts to fall. At time  `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is  `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square  `(0, 0)`. What is the least time until you can reach the bottom right square  `(N-1, N-1)`?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[0,2],[1,3]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
At time `0`, you are in grid location `(0, 0)`.
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You cannot reach point `(1, 1)` until time `3`.
When the depth of water is `3`, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:**
 **0  1  2  3  4**
24 23 22 21  **5**
**12 13 14 15 16**
**11** 17 18 19 20
**10  9  8  7  6**

The final route is marked in bold.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

**Note:**

1.  `2 <= N <= 50`.
2.  grid[i][j] is a permutation of [0, ..., N*N - 1].
## Solution

  

### Approach 1: DFS + Binary Search

#### Intuition
Our results will be in range (targetHeight, n^2-1) and we are looking for the minimum water height. We should use binary search to save time.

For each search, we will need to do a DFS based on current height

#### Algorithm
1. Binary search on all possible results
2. Test height with DFS and move accordingly
3. Find the minimum height that allows us to reach bottom right

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(row, col, time):
            if 0 <= row < n and 0 <= col < n:
                if (row, col) not in visited:
                    visited.add((row, col))
                    if grid[row][col] <= time:
                        if row == n-1 and col == n-1:
                            return True
                        return dfs(row+1, col, time) or dfs(row, col+1, time) or dfs(row-1, col, time) or dfs(row, col-1, time)
            return False
        n = len(grid)
        minTime, maxTime = grid[n-1][n-1], n*n-1
        while minTime < maxTime:
            mid = (minTime+maxTime)//2
            visited = set()
            if dfs(0, 0, mid):
                maxTime = mid
            else:
                minTime = mid+1
        return minTime
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n^2logn^2)
	- Binary search takes O(logn^2) searches. Since possible results are from 0 to n^2
	- Each search is a dfs with memorization which takes O(n^2) time
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), Our visited set

### Approach 2: Union Find data structure


#### Intuition

On each moment of time we can update connected component and wait for the moment when `0` and `N^2-1` are in the same component.

#### Algorithm
1. Start with empty Union Find data structure
2. Union connected points in Union Find data structure as water level raises
3. return answer once top-left and bottom-right points to same value (connected)

#### Code
```python
class DSU(object):
    def __init__(self, N):
        self.par = list(range(N))
        self.rnk = [0] * N

    def find(self, x):
        if self.par[x] != x:
            self.par[x] = self.find(self.par[x])
        return self.par[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        xr, yr = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if xr == yr:
            return False
        elif self.rnk[xr] < self.rnk[yr]:
            self.par[xr] = yr
        elif self.rnk[xr] > self.rnk[yr]:
            self.par[yr] = xr
        else:
            self.par[yr] = xr
            self.rnk[xr] += 1
        return True

class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid):
        d, N = {}, len(grid)
        for i,j in product(range(N), range(N)):
            d[grid[i][j]] = (i, j)
        
        dsu = DSU(N*N)
        grid = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)] 
        neib_list = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]
        
        for i in range(N*N):
            x, y = d[i]
            grid[x][y] = 1
            for dx, dy in neib_list:
                if N>x+dx>=0 and N>y+dy>=0 and grid[x+dx][y+dy] == 1:
                    dsu.union((x+dx)*N + y + dy, x*N + y)
                    
            if dsu.find(0) == dsu.find(N*N-1): return i
```

#### Complexity Analysis

-  **Time Complexity:** `O(N^2 *log N)` if we use union find with ranks (in code above) and `O(N^2)` if we use it with ranks and paths compression
  

-  **Space Complexity:** `O(N^2)`, Our data structure

### Approach 3: Heap


#### Intuition

We perform usual dfs, start with `(0,0)` corner, but on each moment of time we choose node with smallest value to visit. In this way when we reached `(N-1, N-1)` corner, the answer will be the maximum of visited cells so far.

#### Algorithm
1. Start our heap with top-left corner values
2. Push possible next moves to heap
3. Choose the minimum one to move (We dont care about optimizing total moves)
4. First time we moved to bottom-left means we are at the minimum height

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid):
        N, heap, visited, res = len(grid), [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)], set([(0, 0)]), 0
        
        for i in range(N*N):
            val, x, y = heappop(heap)
            res = max(res, val)
            if x == N-1 and y == N-1: return res
            neib_list = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]
            
            for dx, dy in neib_list:
                if (x + dx, y + dy) not in visited and 0<=x+dx<N and 0<=y+dy<N:
                    heappush(heap, (grid[x+dx][y+dy], x+dx, y+dy))
                    visited.add((x+dx, y+dy))
```

#### Complexity Analysis

-  **Time Complexity:** `O(N^2 *log N)` Heap push operations in loops
  

-  **Space Complexity:** `O(N^2)`, Our data structure
