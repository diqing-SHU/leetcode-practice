# 1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target

  

  

  

## Question:


Given a  `matrix` and a  `target`, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to  target.

A submatrix  `x1, y1, x2, y2`  is the set of all cells  `matrix[x][y]`  with  `x1 <= x <= x2`  and  `y1 <= y <= y2`.

Two submatrices  `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`  and  `(x1', y1', x2', y2')`  are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if  `x1 != x1'`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]], target = 0
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the 2x2 submatrix.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = [[904]], target = 0
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= matrix.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= matrix[0].length <= 100`
-   `-1000 <= matrix[i] <= 1000`
-   `-10^8 <= target <= 10^8`
## Solution:

**Approach 1: Cumulative Sum + DP**
Our solution consists two parts: 
1. Create our dp array that we can use to get sum of any submatrix in O(1) time
2. Use that dp array to count number of submatrices with sum == target

In order to get sum of a submatrix of `topLeft(k1, i)`, `bottomRight(k2, j)`, we can use `dp[i, j, k2] - dp[i, j, k1]`. In another word, we need all combinations for `rowStart, rowEnd, col`(or `row, colStart, colEnd`). but anyways, O(n^3) is needed to calculate that

For submatrices with sum == target, there are 2 scenarios: 
1. sum is the difference of two submatrices in dp
2. sum is equal to one of the submatrix in dp
We can use 2 sums to get the counts. Don't forget to add `0` with count 1 to our visited sum to handle second case (one sum).
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubmatrixSumTarget(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> int:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp, ans = {}, 0
        for k in range(m):
            # build the accumulate sum array for row k
            t = [0] + list(accumulate(matrix[k]))
            # use that to calculate our dp
            # each dp[i, j, k] = sum of submatrix of topLeft(0, i), bottomRight(m, j)
            # dp[i, j, k] = dp.get[i,j,k-1] + t[j] - t[i]
            # use i, j of current row, as well as dp from last row
            for i, j in combinations(range(n+1), 2):
                dp[i, j, k] = dp.get((i,j,k-1), 0) + t[j] - t[i]
        # sum of submatrix of topLeft(k1, i), bottomRight(k2, j) can be represented as T[dp[i, j, k2]] - T[dp[i, j, k1]]
        # we only count if sum === target
        # thus, for each k, we are looking for k'
        # that together produce target (sum for k - sum for k' = target)
        for i, j in combinations(range(n+1), 2):
            # 0 is needed for submatrix start at 0 (one sum)
            T = Counter([0])
            for k in range(m):
                # added counts for k'
                ans += T[dp[i, j, k] - target]
                # count curr appearance
                T[dp[i, j, k]] += 1
        return ans
```

  

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n^2m) produce dp takes O(n^2m) (or O(n^3))

SC:O(n^2m) the size of dp array is O(n^2m) (or O(n^3))
