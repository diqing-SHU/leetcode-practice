## Question:

  

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

  

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

  

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

  

  

Example 1:

  
  

Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:

  
  

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 42

Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

  

Constraints:

  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

  

## Solution:

**Approach 1: Bottom-up DFS**

We return the max path sum we have until this node. To calculate a max sum, simply do `leftMax + node.val + rightMax`. 

One thing to keep in mind, if we have a `leftMax` or `rightMax` smaller than 0, we can choose to drop them and use 0 as our single path sum so far (start from this node)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        maxSum = float('-inf')
        def findMaxPathSum(node):
            nonlocal maxSum
            if node:
	            # Get single path max, drop if neccessary
                leftMax = max(findMaxPathSum(node.left), 0)
                rightMax = max(findMaxPathSum(node.right), 0)
                # Update our max sum
                maxSum = max(maxSum, leftMax+node.val+rightMax)
                # Return max single path sum
                return max(leftMax, rightMax)+node.val
            else:
	            # Return 0 as the start of a single path sum
                return 0
        findMaxPathSum(root)
        return maxSum
```
