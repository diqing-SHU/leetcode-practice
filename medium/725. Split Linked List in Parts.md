# 725. Split Linked List in Parts

## Question

Given the  `head`  of a singly linked list and an integer  `k`, split the linked list into  `k`  consecutive linked list parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return  _an array of the_ `k` _parts_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3], k = 5
**Output:** [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
**Explanation:**
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/split2-lc.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3
**Output:** [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
**Explanation:**
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 50`

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

One pass all nodes to get total size. Then build results around the calculated part size.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass to get total size
2. Calculate part size. Extra will be added to the beginning parts by extending one to each part.
3. Return the array of parts

#### Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def splitListToParts(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> List[Optional[ListNode]]:
        size, curr = 0, head
        while curr:
            curr = curr.next
            size += 1
        partLength = size//k
        extra = size%k
        res = []
        curr, prev = head, None
        for i in range(k):
            res.append(curr)
            if extra > 0:
                extra -= 1
                for j in range(partLength+1):
                    prev = curr
                    curr = curr.next
            else:
                for j in range(partLength):
                    prev = curr
                    curr = curr.next
            if prev:
                prev.next = None
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  One pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, To store results
