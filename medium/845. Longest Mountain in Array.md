## Question:


Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a  _mountain_  if the following properties hold:

-   `B.length >= 3`
-   There exists some  `0 < i < B.length - 1`  such that  `B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]`

(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array  `A` of integers, return the length of the longest _mountain_.

Return  `0`  if there is no mountain.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [2,2,2]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no mountain.

**Note:**

1.  `0 <= A.length <= 10000`
2.  `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`

-   Can you solve it using only one pass?
-   Can you solve it in  `O(1)`  space?
## Solution:
**Approach 1: One pass**
Utilize two flags for rise and fall to identify mountains as we one pass the array
```python
class Solution:
    def longestMountain(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        maxLen, i, rised, falled, tempLen = 0, 0, False, True, 0
        while i < len(A)-1:
            if A[i+1] > A[i]:
                if falled:
                    falled = False
                    rised = True
                    tempLen = 1
                tempLen+=1
            elif A[i+1] < A[i]:
                falled = True
                if rised:
                    tempLen+=1
                    maxLen = max(tempLen,maxLen)
            else:
                rised, falled, tempLen = False, True, 0
            i+=1
        return maxLen
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) One pass


**SC** 
O(1) Constant extra space

**Approach 2: 2 pointers**
Use 2 pointers to travel the whole array. Base as our starting point to look for protainal mountains. End is the pointer we use to track the length of protainal mountain starting from base. We move to end if we actually found a mountain. Otherwise, we move to next number as our base.
```python
class Solution:
    def longestMountain(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(A)
        ans = base = 0

        while base < N:
            end = base
            if end + 1 < N and A[end] < A[end + 1]: #if base is a left-boundary
                #set end to the peak of this potential mountain
                while end+1 < N and A[end] < A[end+1]:
                    end += 1

                if end + 1 < N and A[end] > A[end + 1]: #if end is really a peak..
                    #set 'end' to right-boundary of mountain
                    while end+1 < N and A[end] > A[end+1]:
                        end += 1
                    #record candidate answer
                    ans = max(ans, end - base + 1)

            base = max(end, base + 1)

        return ans
```
