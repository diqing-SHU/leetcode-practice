## Question:

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as  `'A'`,  `'C'`,  `'G'`, and  `'T'`, for example:  `"ACGAATTCCG"`. When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
**Output:** ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
**Output:** ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s[i]`  is  `'A'`,  `'C'`,  `'G'`, or  `'T'`.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Set**
Simply use a set to track all appeared unique 10 digit sequences. Then use another set to track duplicated ones
```python
class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        if len(s)<=10:
            return []
        appearedSet, ansSet = set(), set()
        for i in range(9,len(s)):
            if s[i-9:i+1] in appearedSet:
                ansSet.add(s[i-9:i+1])
            else:
                appearedSet.add(s[i-9:i+1])
        return list(ansSet)
```
