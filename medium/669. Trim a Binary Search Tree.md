# 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

## Question

Given the  `root`  of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as  `low`  and  `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in  `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should  **not**  change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a  **unique answer**.

Return  _the root of the trimmed binary search tree_. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
**Output:** [1,null,2]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
**Output:** [3,2,null,1]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree in the range  `[1, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
- The value of each node in the tree is  **unique**.
- `root`  is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
- `0 <= low <= high <= 104`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Recursion

#### Intuition

If we think about the BST structure. While performing trimming, the base structure doesn't change. We are just "trimming" the nodes that are not in range.
We can use recursion to solve the problem. Lets assume we already constructed the function to trim a sub tree. In that scenario, we just need to make sure we skip to the correct node and use the function to trim left and right child. And the complete the logic for the recursion function itself.

#### Algorithm

1. Move to first valid node if needed
2. Call the recursive function to get and replace the trimmed left and right child
3. Return the trimmed node

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # find next root if current one should be skipped
        while root and not low <= root.val <= high:
            if root.val < low:
                root = root.right
            else:
                root = root.left
        # continue constructing rest of tree
        if root:
            root.left = self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
            root.right = self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        return root
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , Each node can be visited at most once

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , The call stack
