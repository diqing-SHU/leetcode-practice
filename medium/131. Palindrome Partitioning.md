# 131. Palindrome Partitioning

## Question

Given a string  `s`, partition  `s`  such that every substring of the partition is a  **palindrome**. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of  `s`.

A  **palindrome**  string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aab"
**Output:** [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a"
**Output:** [["a"]]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 16`
- `s`  contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Backtrack

#### Intuition

Since we are doing partition on the whole string and will stop early as soon as we cant find a suitable palindrome. Backtrack is a suitable solution here.

#### Algorithm

1. Contiue if we can find a palindrome
2. Stop and back track if we fall back from checking.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = []
        def isPalindrome(start, end):
            while start < end:
                if s[start] != s[end]:
                    return False
                start += 1
                end -= 1
            return True
        def backtrack(start, currAns):
            if start == len(s):
                ans.append(currAns)
            for end in range(start, len(s)):
                if isPalindrome(start, end):
                    currAns.append(s[start:end+1])
                    backtrack(end+1, copy.deepcopy(currAns))
                    currAns.pop()
        backtrack(0, [])
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n*2^n)`, where n is the length of string s. This is the worst-case time complexity when all the possible substrings are palindrome.
 Example, if = s =  `aaa`, the recursive tree can be illustrated as follows:

Hence, there could be  2^N  possible substrings in the worst case. For each substring, it takes O(N)  time to generate substring and determine if it a palindrome or not. This gives us time complexity as  O(Nâ‹…2^N)

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Recursion stack
