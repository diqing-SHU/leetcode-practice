# 75. Sort Colors

## Question

Given an array  `nums`  with  `n`  objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them  **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers  `0`,  `1`, and  `2`  to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
**Output:** [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,0,1]
**Output:** [0,1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** [1]

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]`  is  `0`,  `1`, or  `2`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

Do three one pass swaps to put 0, 1, 2 to corresponding positions

#### Algorithm

1. Use 2 pointer to find index for first non-value and next value
2. Swap the places so that the value will be at the beginning
3. Performing such swaps throughout the list.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        def swapAllElements(value, start):
            p1 = start
            while p1 < len(nums):
                if nums[p1] == value:
                 # skip values that are in correct place
                    p1+=1
                else:
                 # only reset p2 if its not usable
                 if p2 < p1:
                     p2 = p1
                    # find index for next value
                    while nums[p2] != value:
                        p2+=1
                        # end early if we reach the end
                        if p2 == len(nums):
                            return p1
                    # Swap and continue
                    nums[p1], nums[p2] = nums[p2], nums[p1]
            # return starting index for next lookup
            return p1
        currIndex = swapAllElements(0, 0)
        currIndex = swapAllElements(1, currIndex)
        currIndex = swapAllElements(2, currIndex)
```

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  3 one passes

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, All in-place swaps

### Approach 2: 3 pointer

#### Intuition

This problem is called Dutch national flag problem:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem)

The idea here is the following: we keep 3 pointers: for each of colors (numbers). I called them  
`beg = 0`,  `mid = 0`,  `end = len(nums) - 1`. The  **idea**  here is to put sorted  `0`  and  `1`  to the  **beginning**  and sorted  `2`s to the  **end**.

#### Algorithm

we iterate over all elements and process each new element in the following way. Imagine, that we already sorted some of the elements, our invariant will be  `00...0011...11......22....22`, where we already put some  `0`  and  `1`  in the beginning and some  `2`  to the end. Then there are 3 possible cases for new element  `?`:

1. `00...0011...11?......22....22`, where  `? = 1`, then we do not need to change any elements, just move  `mid`  pointer by  `1`  to the right.
2. `00...0011...11?......22....22`, where  `? = 2`, then we need to put this element before the first already sorted  `2`, so we change these elements and then move pointer  `end`  by  `1`  to the left.
3. `00...0011...11?......22....22`, where  `? = 0`, then we need to swap this element with the last sorted  `0`  and also move two pointers  `mid`  and  `beg`  by 1.

We can see it this way, that pointers  `beg`,  `mid`  and  `end`  always point at elements just  `after`  the last  `0`,  `after`  the last  `1`  and  `before`  the first  `2`.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        beg, mid, end = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while mid <= end:
            if nums[mid] == 0:
                nums[beg], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[beg]
                # mid and beg all need to be updated
                mid += 1
                beg += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 2:
                nums[mid], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[mid]
                end -= 1
            else:  #nums[mid] == 1:
                mid += 1
```
