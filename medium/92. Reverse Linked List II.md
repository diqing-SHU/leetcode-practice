# 92. Reverse Linked List II

## Question

Given the  `head`  of a singly linked list and two integers  `left`  and  `right`  where  `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position  `left`  to position  `right`, and return  _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
**Output:** [1,4,3,2,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
**Output:** [5]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is  `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one pass?

## Solution

### Approach 1: One Pass

#### Intuition

We keep three pointers as with any other reverse linked lists problems: `pre, curr, next` and reverse based on that. Here, we need to reach the prev of `left` and start reversing till we reach prev of `right`

#### Algorithm

1. Do  `left-1`  steps to reach the first point of range we need to reverse.
2. Reverse range  `[right - left]`, using 3 pointers approach.
3. Finally we need to fix connections for the start and for the end of reversed list, using saved pointer to  `pre`  element.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, left: int, right: int) -> ListNode:
        # return if we dont need to reverse
        if left == right: return head
        # create dummy head to handle edge case
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        pre = dummy
        # move to pre position
        for i in range(left-1):
            pre = pre.next
        # get curr and nxt to start
        curr = pre.next
        nxt = curr.next
        
        for i in range(right-left):
            # hold further nxt
            tmp = nxt.next
            # reverse nxt
            nxt.next = curr
            # move on
            curr = nxt
            nxt = tmp
        # attend the rest to prev next
        pre.next.next = nxt
        # switch the prev next with curr reversed node
        pre.next = curr
        return dummy.next
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), One pass
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), Constant space
