# 667. Beautiful Arrangement II

  

## Question:

Given two integers  `n`  and  `k`, you need to construct a list which contains  `n`  different positive integers ranging from  `1`  to  `n`  and obeys the following requirement:  
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1  - a2|, |a2  - a3|, |a3  - a4|, ... , |an-1  - an|] has exactly  `k`  distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

**Example 1:**  

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1
**Output:** [1, 2, 3]
**Explanation:** The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.

**Example 2:**  

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2
**Output:** [1, 3, 2]
**Explanation:** The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.

**Note:**  

1.  The  `n`  and  `k`  are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.

## Solution:
**Approach 1: Construct the Array**

If we try to construct couple of arrays, we can notice that 1, 2, ..., up to k will be the k distinct integers. The rest of differences will all be 1. Thus we can construct the array by puting 1s first. Then insert numbers by increasing/decreasing corresponding differences.

```python
class Solution:
    def constructArray(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        totalGaps = n-1
        currNum = 1
        res = [1]
        onesLeft = totalGaps-k
        while onesLeft>0:
            currNum+=1
            onesLeft-=1
            res.append(currNum)
        # build the rest
        prevPlus = False
        while len(res) < n:
            if prevPlus:
                prevPlus = False
                currNum-=k
            else:
                prevPlus = True
                currNum+=k
            res.append(currNum)
            k-=1
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**


TC:O(n) one pass to construct the array

SC:O(1) Constant space except the result array
