# 954. Array of Doubled Pairs

## Question

Given an integer array of even length  `arr`, return  `true` _if it is possible to reorder_ `arr` _such that_ `arr[2 * i + 1] = 2 * arr[2 * i]` _for every_ `0 <= i < len(arr) / 2`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [3,1,3,6]
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [2,1,2,6]
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [4,-2,2,-4]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can take two groups, [-2,-4] and [2,4] to form [-2,-4,2,4] or [2,4,-2,-4].

**Example 4:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,4,16,8,4]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arr.length <= 3 * 104`
- `arr.length`  is even.
- `-105  <= arr[i] <= 105`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Sort

#### Intuition

If we have a solution, that means every one of the element will be mapped to either element//2(if even) or element*2.
By tracking the appeared numbers in dictionary, we can reduce the lookup time. However, we still need to determine whether we should pick element//2(if even) or element*2 if we have both.

We can sort the numbers so that we can always look for element//2 for positive numbers and element*2 for negative numbers (they will be stored in dict first)

#### Algorithm

1. Sort the numbers
2. One pass all numbers while checking for other number in pair
3. We should have empty dict at the end of the pass

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def canReorderDoubled(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        appearDict = {}
        for num in arr:
            if num not in appearDict:
                appearDict[num] = 0
            appearDict[num] += 1
        for key in sorted(appearDict.keys()):
            if key < 0:
                if appearDict[key] > 0:
                    if key%2 == 1 or key//2 not in appearDict:
                        return False
                    appearDict[key//2] -= appearDict[key]
                    appearDict[key] = 0
            else:
                if appearDict[key] > 0:
                    if key*2 not in appearDict:
                        return False
                    appearDict[key*2] -= appearDict[key]
                    appearDict[key] = 0
        for key in appearDict:
            if appearDict[key] != 0:
                return False
        return True
```

Rewrite with sort first

```python
class Solution:
    def canReorderDoubled(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        appearDict = {}
        for num in sorted(arr):
            if num < 0:
                if num*2 in appearDict:
                    appearDict[num*2] -= 1
                    if appearDict[num*2] == 0:
                        del appearDict[num*2]
                else:
                    if num not in appearDict:
                        appearDict[num] = 0
                    appearDict[num] += 1
            else:
                if num%2 == 0 and num//2 in appearDict:
                    appearDict[num//2] -= 1
                    if appearDict[num//2] == 0:
                        del appearDict[num//2]
                else:
                    if num not in appearDict:
                        appearDict[num] = 0
                    appearDict[num] += 1
        if len(appearDict) > 0:
            return False
        return True
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(nlogn)`, Sorting is the bottleneck

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Our appearance dict
