# 63. Unique Paths II

## Question:
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a  `m x n`  grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space is marked as  `1`  and  `0`  respectively in the grid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

**Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

-   `m == obstacleGrid.length`
-   `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
-   `obstacleGrid[i][j]`  is  `0`  or  `1`.
## Solution:

**Approach 1: Bottom-up**
Bottom-up dfs from destination to start. This will end up TLE.
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        def dfs(row, col):
            # check if curr position is valid
            if row < 0 or col < 0:
                return 0
            # check if barrier
            if obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1:
                return 0
            # check if we reach the start
            if row == 0 and col == 0:
                return 1
            # keep moving
            return dfs(row, col-1) + dfs(row-1, col)
        return dfs(m-1, n-1)
```
If we implement memorization. It will pass since we eliminate redundant calculation. A HashMap for visited node or `lru_cache`for called function can do the trick.
```python
from functools import lru_cache
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def dfs(row, col):
            # check if curr position is valid
            if row < 0 or col < 0:
                return 0
            # check if barrier
            if obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1:
                return 0
            # check if we reach the start
            if row == 0 and col == 0:
                return 1
            # keep moving
            return dfs(row, col-1) + dfs(row-1, col)
        return dfs(m-1, n-1)
```
  
**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) after memorization

SC:O(n) recursion is called on each node

----------

**Approach 2: DP**
We have a dp relation here: `dp[i, j] = dp[i, j-1] + dp[i-1, j]`
We can construct dp solution based on that
  
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # dp relation: dp[i, j] = dp[i, j-1] + dp[i-1, j]
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        # handle edge case
        if obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1] == 1 or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if row == 0 and col == 0:
                    dp[0][0] = 1
                elif row == 0:
                    if obstacleGrid[0][col] == 0:
                        dp[0][col] = dp[0][col-1]
                elif col == 0:
                    if obstacleGrid[row][0] == 0:
                        dp[row][0] = dp[row-1][0]
                else:
                    if obstacleGrid[row][col] == 0:
                        dp[row][col] = dp[row][col-1] + dp[row-1][col]
        return dp[m-1][n-1]

```
**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) All element visited once

SC:O(n), extra dp array. Can be O(1) if we mutate input array.
