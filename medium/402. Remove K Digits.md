# 402. Remove K Digits

## Question

Given string num representing a non-negative integer  `num`, and an integer  `k`, return  _the smallest possible integer after removing_  `k`  _digits from_  `num`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "1432219", k = 3
**Output:** "1219"
**Explanation:** Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "10200", k = 1
**Output:** "200"
**Explanation:** Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = "10", k = 2
**Output:** "0"
**Explanation:** Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= num.length <= 105`
- `num`  consists of only digits.
- `num`  does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Stack

#### Intuition

By meaning greedy, we mean to start from most significant digit (left most digit). If you can replace that digit (k>0) with a smaller number (by removing that digit), you remove it. The following digit takes the place and the number becomes smaller. And as you are operating from most significant digit, the resulting number is guaranteed to be the smallest.

then come back to question, we know we can remove at most k digit to generate new digit  
so we can add/remove until k == 0

#### Algorithm

1. First think in terms of stack
2. push num into stack IF num it is greater than top of stack
3. ELSE pop all elements less than num

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(num)):
            while True:
          # stop if we cant pop anymore
                if k == 0 or not stack:
                    break
    # pop since we want replace with lower number
                if stack[-1] > num[i]:
                    k -= 1
                    stack.pop()
                # otherwise, no need to pop
                else:
                    break
            # add current digit in
            stack.append(num[i])
        # if we have more, just pop end since its increasing
        while k != 0:
            stack.pop()
            k -= 1
        # remove leading 0s
        for i in range(len(stack)):
            if stack[i] != "0":
                break
        stack = stack[i:]

        if not stack:
            return "0"
        return "".join(stack)
            
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , one pass all elements

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , stack size
