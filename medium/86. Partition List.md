# 86. Partition List

  

## Question:
Given the  `head`  of a linked list and a value  `x`, partition it such that all nodes  **less than**  `x`  come before nodes  **greater than or equal**  to  `x`.

You should  **preserve**  the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
**Output:** [1,2,2,4,3,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [2,1], x = 2
**Output:** [1,2]

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 200]`.
-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
-   `-200 <= x <= 200`


## Solution:
**Approach 1: 2 Pointer**

We can go through the linked list and append to separate higher and lower nodes. In the end we connect the end of lower to head of higher.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        currInHigherHead = higherHead = ListNode()
        currInLowerHead = res = ListNode()
        curr = head
        while curr:
            if curr.val < x:
                currInLowerHead.next = curr
                currInLowerHead = currInLowerHead.next
            else:
                currInHigherHead.next = curr
                currInHigherHead = currInHigherHead.next
            curr = curr.next
        currInHigherHead.next = None
        currInLowerHead.next = higherHead.next
        return res.next
                
```

**Complexity Analysis**


TC:O(n) one pass all nodes

SC:O(1) created two dummy head
