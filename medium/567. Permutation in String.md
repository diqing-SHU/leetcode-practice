# 567. Permutation in String

## Question

Given two strings  `s1`  and  `s2`, return  `true` _if_ `s2` _contains a permutation of_ `s1`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

In other words, return  `true`  if one of  `s1`'s permutations is the substring of  `s2`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104`
- `s1`  and  `s2`  consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Sliding window

#### Intuition

Keep a window with fixed size same as s1 and loop through s2. We can use a hashmap to keep counts to save space and simplify comparing.(or an array in this case)

#### Algorithm

1. Sliding through s2 with a window size of s1
2. Add and remove count of the elements that enter and leave sliding window
3. Return as soon as we found an answer

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) > len(s2):
            return False
        s1Counter = Counter(s1)
        s2Counter = Counter(s2[:len(s1)])
        for indexToAdd in range(len(s1), len(s2)):
            if s1Counter == s2Counter:
                return True
            indexToRemove = indexToAdd-len(s1)
            s2Counter[s2[indexToRemove]]-=1
            s2Counter[s2[indexToAdd]]+=1
        # check last case
        if s1Counter == s2Counter:
            return True
        return False
            
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(l1+26*(l2-l1))` , comparing require looping through dict which can be 26 at max

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` Dict can have 26 elements at max
