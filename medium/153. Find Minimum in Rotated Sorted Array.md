# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Question

Suppose an array of length  `n`  sorted in ascending order is  **rotated**  between  `1`  and  `n`  times. For example, the array  `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]`  might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`  if it was rotated  `4`  times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]`  if it was rotated  `7`  times.

Notice that  **rotating**  an array  `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]`  1 time results in the array  `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array  `nums`  of  **unique**  elements, return  _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [11,13,15,17]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of  `nums`  are  **unique**.
- `nums`  is sorted and rotated between  `1`  and  `n`  times.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Binary search

#### Intuition

We are looking for the smallest number in a sorted list. If its not rotated(or rotated to original order), since its increasing, it will just be the first one. Otherwise, we will have two increasing part and the smallest will be the start of the second part.

We can use binary search concept. And move based on the value of lo, min and hi

#### Algorithm

1. Binary search the array
2. Move based on values
3. Stop once we find the minimum

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def search(lo, hi):
            while lo < hi:
                mid = (lo + hi) // 2
                if mid == lo or mid == hi:
                    return min(nums[lo], nums[hi], nums[mid])
                if nums[lo] < nums[mid] < nums[hi]:
                    return nums[lo]
                elif nums[lo] < nums[mid] and nums[mid] > nums[hi]:
                    lo = mid
                elif nums[lo] > nums[mid] and nums[mid] < nums[hi]:
                    hi = mid
            return min(nums[lo], nums[hi])
        return search(0, len(nums)-1)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(logn)`,  binary search

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, constant space
