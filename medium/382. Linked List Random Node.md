# 382. Linked List Random Node

## Question

Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the  **same probability**  of being chosen.

Implement the  `Solution`  class:

- `Solution(ListNode head)`  Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- `int getRandom()`  Chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. All the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be choosen.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/16/getrand-linked-list.jpg)

**Input**
["Solution", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom", "getRandom"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], [], [], []]
**Output**
[null, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3]

**Explanation**
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.getRandom(); // return 1
solution.getRandom(); // return 3
solution.getRandom(); // return 2
solution.getRandom(); // return 2
solution.getRandom(); // return 3
// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the linked list will be in the range  `[1, 104]`.
- `-104  <= Node.val <= 104`
- At most  `104`  calls will be made to  `getRandom`.

**Follow up:**

- What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you?
- Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

## Solution

### Approach 1: BF

#### Intuition

We need to one pass all linked list to get the length first. Then we can get a random index and get corresponding value

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all linked list
2. Get random index and get the value of it

#### Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
from random import randrange

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        self.head = head
        p, self.length = head, 0
        while p:
            p = p.next
            self.length += 1
        

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        p = self.head
        randomIndex = random.randint(0,self.length-1)
        while randomIndex > 0:
            randomIndex -= 1
            p = p.next
        return p.val
            

# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(head)
# param_1 = obj.getRandom()

# Your MyCalendarTwo object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendarTwo()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n) and O(n)` one passe

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` constant extra space

### Approach 2: Extra value list

#### Intuition

Similar idea to the first approach. But we store values in one pass to save time with space

#### Algorithm

1. One pass and fill all linked list
2. Get random index and get the value of it

#### Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
from random import randrange

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, head: Optional[ListNode]):
        self.valueList = []
        while head:
            self.valueList.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        randomIndex = random.randint(0,len(self.valueList)-1)
        return self.valueList[randomIndex]
            

# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(head)
# param_1 = obj.getRandom()
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n) and O(1)`,  look up time is O(1)

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, to store values

### Approach 3: Reservoir sampling

#### Intuition

Imagine, that we have only  `3`  nodes in our linked list, then we do the following logic:

1. On the first step we either stay in first node with probability  `1/2`  or go to the next one also with probability  `1/2`.
2. On the second step, we do the following: if we are in node number  **1**, then we stay in this node with probability  `2/3`  and go to node number  **2**  with probability  `1/3`. If we in node number  **2**, then we stay in it with probability  `1/3`  and go to node number  **3**  with probability  `2/3`. Why everything will be OK? There is only one way, how you can stay in node  **1**, and probability is  `1/2 * 2/3`. There are two cases, how you can go to node number  **2**: stay on first step and go on second and go on first step and stay on second: probability will be  `1/2*1/3 + 1/2*1/3 = 1/3`. Finally, probability to be in node  **3**  is also  `1/3`.

Now, imagine, that we already covered  `n`  nodes and we have probabilities:  `1/n, 1/n, ..., 1/n`. Then we need to make one more step and have probabilities  `1/(n+1), 1/(n+1), ... , 1/(n+1)`. How we can do it?

1. If we are in the first node, we stay in it with probability  `n/(n+1)`  and go next with probability  `1/(n+1)`.

2. If we are in the second node, we stay in it with probability  `(n-1)/(n+1)`  and go next with probability  `2/(n+1)`.

    n. If we are in node  `n`, we stai in it with probability  `1/(n+1)`  and go next with probability  `n/(n+1)`.

Why it is working? There is only one way how you can be in node  **1**: with probability  `1/n* n/(n+1) = 1/(n+1)`. There is two options for node  **2**, with probability  `1/n*(n-1)/(n+1) + 1/n* 1/(n+1) = 1/(n+1)`  and so on.

#### Algorithm

1. we keep `n` and `k` values: `n` is number of nodes we count in list so far and `k` is current node we are in.
2. Each moment of time we decide if we go to next node or rest in current.
3. If we go to next, we increase `k` by one and change our `ans` node. Increase `n` in any case.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, head):
        self.head = head

    def getRandom(self):
        n, k = 1, 1
        head, ans = self.head, self.head
        while head.next:
            n += 1
            head = head.next
            if random.random() < k/n:
                ans = ans.next
                k += 1
                
        return ans.val
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Still need to traverse

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, No extra space
