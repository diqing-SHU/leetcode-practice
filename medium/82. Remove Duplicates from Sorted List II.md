# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

## Question

Given the  `head`  of a sorted linked list,  _delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list_. Return  _the linked list  **sorted**  as well_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
**Output:** [1,2,5]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist2.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,1,1,2,3]
**Output:** [2,3]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be  **sorted**  in ascending order.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Sliding window

#### Intuition

We need to one pass the linked list and append nodes if it appears only once in a row. To achieve that, we simply slide to longest same value at curr node and append if there is only one in the range.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass the nodes
2. Sliding our window for same values
3. Append if we have only one in the window. Otherwise, just skip

#### Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        dummyHead = curr = ListNode()
        while head:
            count = 1
            nextNode = head.next
            while nextNode and head.val == nextNode.val:
                nextNode = nextNode.next
                count += 1
            if count == 1:
                curr.next = head
                curr = curr.next
                head = head.next
            else:
                head = nextNode
        # break in the end
        curr.next = None
        return dummyHead.next
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , max one pass all nodes

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , constant extra space
