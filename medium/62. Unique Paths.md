# 62. Unique Paths

## Question

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:

1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

## Solution

**Approach 1: DP**
The number of ways to reach point(m,n) is the ways to reach point(m-1,n) + the ways to reach point(m,n-1). (Since we can only move right or down by one at a time)
Thus, we can use dp array to keep track

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * m for i in range(n)]
        for row in range(n):
            for col in range(m): 
                if row == 0:
                    dp[row][col] = 1
                elif col == 0:
                    dp[row][col] = 1
                else:
                    dp[row][col] = dp[row-1][col] + dp[row][col-1]
        return dp[n-1][m-1]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(mn) Goes through all points

SC:O(mn) the size of dp array
----------

**Approach 2: DP with constant space**
We can simplify the dp approach since the calculation doesn't necessarily require to store the whole array

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        previousVals = [1] * m
        for row in range(1,n):
            for col in range(1,m): 
                previousVals[col] = previousVals[col]+previousVals[col-1]
        return previousVals[m-1]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(mn) Goes through all points

SC:O(m) not much improvement
