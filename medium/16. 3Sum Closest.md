# 16. 3Sum Closest

## Question

Given an array  `nums`  of  _n_  integers and an integer  `target`, find three integers in  `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

## Solution

### Approach 1: 2 pointers

#### Intuition

Basically, we need to check all possible combinations that are around target.

We only care about sum, in other word, we are considering combination instead of permutation. We can use 2 pointer on sorted list for each element that we want to check. Narrow the range and calculate all the combs.

#### Algorithm

1. Loop through all nums
2. Take the current num and narrow our range for other two numbers after current num (to get no duplicated combs).
3. return the best answer after all combs are checked

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        nums.sort()
        n, ans = len(nums), float("inf")

        for i in range(n):
            beg, end = i + 1, n - 1
   # 2 pointers to loop through all combs with i
            while beg < end:
                sm = nums[beg] + nums[end] + nums[i]
                ans = min(ans, sm, key = lambda x: abs(x - target))
        
                if sm <= target:
                    beg += 1
                elif sm > target:
                    end -= 1
                    
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n^2)`, the inner loop for 2 pointer can only move up to O(n)

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`
