# 1094. Car Pooling

## Question

You are driving a vehicle that has  `capacity`  empty seats initially available for passengers. The vehicle  **only**  drives east (ie. it  **cannot**  turn around and drive west.)

Given a list of  `trips`,  `trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location, end_location]` contains information about the  `i`-th trip: the number of passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop them off. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.

Return  `true`  if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** trips = [[2,1,5],[3,5,7]], capacity = 3
**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

**Input:** trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

1. `trips.length <= 1000`
2. `trips[i].length == 3`
3. `1 <= trips[i][0] <= 100`
4. `0 <= trips[i][1] < trips[i][2] <= 1000`
5. `1 <= capacity <= 100000`

## Solution

**Approach 1: Sort**
By sorting the timestamps based on pick up and drop off time, we can keep track of number of passengers while we going through all timestamps.

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        pickUp = sorted(trips, key=lambda l:l[1])
        dropOff = sorted(trips, key=lambda l:l[2])
        pIndex, dIndex, currentNum = 0, 0, 0
        while pIndex < len(trips) and dIndex < len(trips):
            if pickUp[pIndex][1] < dropOff[dIndex][2]:
                currentNum+=pickUp[pIndex][0]
                pIndex+=1
            else:
                currentNum-=dropOff[dIndex][0]
                dIndex+=1
            if currentNum>capacity:
                return False
        while pIndex < len(trips):
            currentNum+=pickUp[pIndex][1]
            pIndex+=1
            if currentNum>capacity:
                return False
        return True
```

Simplify our code with one array of size 2n:

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        timestamp = []
        for trip in trips:
            timestamp.append([trip[1], trip[0]])
            # Append with negative to help calculation
            timestamp.append([trip[2], -trip[0]])

        timestamp.sort()

        used_capacity = 0
        for time, passenger_change in timestamp:
            used_capacity += passenger_change
            if used_capacity > capacity:
                return False

        return True
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC**
O(nlogn). Sorting takes longer time O(nlogn) compared to one pass with O(n)

**SC**
O(n) We need to store the sorted list

**Approach 2: Bucket Sort**
Note that in the problem there is a interesting constraint:

> 4. `0 <= trips[i][1] < trips[i][2] <= 1000`

What pops into the mind is [Bucket Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort), which is a sorting algorithm in O(N)  time but requires some prior knowledge for the range of the data.

We can use it instead of the normal sorting in this method.

What we do is initial 1001 buckets, and put the number of passengers changed in corresponding buckets, and collect the buckets one by one.

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
     # There are only 1000 possible dates
        timestamp = [0] * 1001
        for trip in trips:
            timestamp[trip[1]] += trip[0]
            timestamp[trip[2]] -= trip[0]

        used_capacity = 0
        for passenger_change in timestamp:
            used_capacity += passenger_change
            if used_capacity > capacity:
                return False

        return True
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC**
O(max(N,1001)) Since we need to iterate over `trips` and then iterate over our 1001 buckets.

**SC**
O(1) We only have 1001 as extra space
