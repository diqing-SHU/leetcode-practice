# 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

  

## Question
Given an integer array  `nums`  of size  `n`, return  _the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal_.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by  `1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,10,2,9]
**Output:** 16

**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
-   `-109  <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Solution

  

### Approach 1: Linear search

#### Intuition
Any value that are not in the array can't be the optimal answer. Thus, we know that answer will land in max and min of the array. 
We can start our trial with linear search. Although we should be able to binary search with array sorted. We can't decide to search left half or right half as the sum of abs differences is not necessarily related to the value of target. And we dont have a target sum to search. We just want the minimum.

#### Algorithm
Create a helper to generate move for a target value.
Use a counter to reduce some run time. Not much as values can all be unique.
Go though the counter and generate all possible moves.
Minium will be our answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def generateMoves(target):
            res = 0
            for value in numsCounter:
                res += numsCounter[value]*abs(value-target)
            return res
        numsCounter = Counter(nums)
        res = float('inf')
        for key in numsCounter:
            res = min(generateMoves(key), res)
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), nested for loops
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), if we use dict, O(1) if we don't

### Approach 2: Get Median


#### Intuition
Think about the question as finding the point on line, such that sum of distances to this point is minimal. Thus, we should find the median of the them as its more closer to the center. We can get the median by removing largest and smallest num until we get answer.

#### Algorithm
Sort the nums so that we can start our algorithm.
In terms of getting moves, if we think about it:
```python
#right moves
moves += nums[right] - median
#left moves
moves += median - nums[left]
```

add them together

```python
moves += nums[right] - median + median - nums[left] =>  nums[right] - nums[left]
```
We don't actually need to know median.

#### Code
With 2 pointers
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        lp,rp = 0, len(nums) - 1
        move_count = 0
        while lp < rp:
            if lp == rp:
                move_count += nums[rp]
            else:
                move_count += nums[rp] - nums[lp]
            lp += 1
            rp -= 1
        return move_count
```
Beautiful one liner with zip

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(sorted(nums), sorted(nums)[::-1]))//2
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(nlogn)
	- Sort takes O(nlogn)
	- 2 pointer takes O(n)
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), store sorted list. O(1) if we mutate data
