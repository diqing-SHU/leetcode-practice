# 55. Jump Game

## Question

You are given an integer array  `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's  **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return  `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Extend range

#### Intuition

To check if we can reach the end, we simply need to check the furthest point we can jump to at each position in current range.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all position that we are able to land
2. Use the furthest position to compare

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        currEnd, start = 0, 0
        while start <= currEnd:
            currEnd = max(start+nums[start], currEnd)
            if currEnd >= len(nums)-1:
                return True
            start+=1
        return False
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  One pass all elements

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, Constant extra space
