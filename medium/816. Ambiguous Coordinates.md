# 816. Ambiguous Coordinates

## Question

We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like  `"(1, 3)"`  or  `"(2, 0.5)"`. Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces, and ended up with the string `s`. Return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.

Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with less digits. Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it, so we never started with numbers like ".1".

The final answer list can be returned in any order. Also note that all coordinates in the final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)

**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "(123)"
**Output:** ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]

**Example 2:**
**Input:** s = "(00011)"
**Output:**  ["(0.001, 1)", "(0, 0.011)"]
**Explanation:**
0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.

**Example 3:**
**Input:** s = "(0123)"
**Output:** ["(0, 123)", "(0, 12.3)", "(0, 1.23)", "(0.1, 23)", "(0.1, 2.3)", "(0.12, 3)"]

**Example 4:**
**Input:** s = "(100)"
**Output:** [(10, 0)]
**Explanation:**
1.0 is not allowed.

**Note:**

- `4 <= s.length <= 12`.
- `s[0]`  = "(",  `s[s.length - 1]`  = ")", and the other elements in  `s`  are digits.
  
## Solution

### Approach 1: Build all possible numbers

#### Intuition

We basically build and validate each possible numbers

#### Algorithm

Divide the string into 2 substrings.

Then, build all possible decimals plus the int we had and validate. If its valid, add to our list.

In the end, we build all combinations with left and right candidates for that iteration

```python
class Solution:
    def ambiguousCoordinates(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        def checkNum(numString):
            if numString[0] == '0' and len(numString) > 1:
                return False
            return True
            
        def checkDecimal(leftString, rightString):
            if leftString[0] == '0' and len(leftString) > 1:
                return False
            if rightString[-1] == '0' and len(rightString) >= 1:
                return False
            return True
            
        def buildNum(start, end):
            res = []
            for i in range(start+1, end):
                left, right = s[start:i], s[i:end]
                if checkDecimal(left, right):
                    res.append(left+'.'+right)
            if checkNum(s[start:end]):
                res.append(s[start:end])
            return res
        
        ans = []
        for i in range(2, len(s)-1):
            for leftNum in buildNum(1, i):
                for rightNum in buildNum(i, len(s)-1):
                    ans.append('('+leftNum+', '+rightNum+')')
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^3)
  - O(n^3) for triple nested for loops. Two of the results we are looping through `buildNum` results, which is `O(n)` in size
  - O(1) for check functions.
  - O(n) for `buildNum`
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^3), we store in the nested for loops.
