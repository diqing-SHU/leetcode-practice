# 1465. Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts

  

## Question

Given a rectangular cake with height  `h`  and width  `w`, and two arrays of integers  `horizontalCuts`  and  `verticalCuts`  where  `horizontalCuts[i]`  is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the  `ith`  horizontal cut and similarly,  `verticalCuts[j]`  is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the  `jth` vertical cut.

_Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays  `horizontalCuts`  and  `verticalCuts`._ Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]
**Output:** 4 
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red lines are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the green piece of cake has the maximum area.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/14/leetcode_max_area_3.png)**

**Input:** h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3,1], verticalCuts = [1]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. Red lines are the horizontal and vertical cuts. After you cut the cake, the green and yellow pieces of cake have the maximum area.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3], verticalCuts = [3]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= h, w <= 10^9`
-   `1 <= horizontalCuts.length < min(h, 10^5)`
-   `1 <= verticalCuts.length < min(w, 10^5)`
-   `1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h`
-   `1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w`
-   It is guaranteed that all elements in `horizontalCuts` are distinct.
-   It is guaranteed that all elements in  `verticalCuts` are distinct.
## Solution

  

### Approach 1: Sort

#### Intuition
Since the cut goes across the whole cake, length of all areas after cut are the length between each two adjacent cuts.

Therefore, if we sort the cuts. We can get the max length between horizontal cuts and vertical cuts (and borders).

And that will make our maximum area.

#### Algorithm
1. Sort both cuts arrays
2. One pass them to get `horizontalMaxLength` and `verticalMaxLength`
3. return the product as our maximum area

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, h: int, w: int, horizontalCuts: List[int], verticalCuts: List[int]) -> int:
        horizontalMaxLength, verticalMaxLength = 0, 0
        horizontalCuts.sort()
        verticalCuts.sort()
        prevCut = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for horizontalCut in horizontalCuts+[h]:
            horizontalMaxLength = max(horizontalCut-prevCut, horizontalMaxLength)
            prevCut = horizontalCut
        prevCut = 0
        for verticalCut in verticalCuts+[w]:
            verticalMaxLength = max(verticalCut-prevCut, verticalMaxLength)
            prevCut = verticalCut
        horizontalMaxLength%=mod
        verticalMaxLength%=mod
        return horizontalMaxLength*verticalMaxLength%mod
```
Fancy!
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, h: int, w: int, horizontalCuts: List[int], verticalCuts: List[int]) -> int:
        H = sorted([0] + horizontalCuts + [h])
        V = sorted([0] + verticalCuts + [w])
        return max(j-i for i,j in zip(H, H[1:])) * max(j-i for i,j in zip(V, V[1:])) % (10**9 + 7)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(hlogh+vlogv), bottle neck is the sorts
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(h+v), if we don't mutate the input arrays
