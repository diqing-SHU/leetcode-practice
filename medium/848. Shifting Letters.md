# 848. Shifting Letters

## Question

You are given a string  `s`  of lowercase English letters and an integer array  `shifts`  of the same length.

Call the  `shift()`  of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that  `'z'`  becomes  `'a'`).

- For example,  `shift('a') = 'b'`,  `shift('t') = 'u'`, and  `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each  `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first  `i + 1`  letters of  `s`,  `x`  times.

Return  _the final string after all such shifts to s are applied_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
**Output:** "rpl"
**Explanation:** We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]
**Output:** "gfd"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  consists of lowercase English letters.
- `shifts.length == s.length`
- `0 <= shifts[i] <= 109`

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

We just need to one pass all elements and perform the shifts. Since shift of one element depends on the previous one, we can start from the end.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass from the end to start
2. Shift each element

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def shiftingLetters(self, s: str, shifts: List[int]) -> str:
        def shift(currChar, numOfShift):
            numOfShift = numOfShift%26
            if numOfShift <= ord('z') - ord(currChar):
                return chr(ord(currChar) + numOfShift)
            return chr(ord(currChar) + numOfShift - 26)
        prevShift, res = 0, ''
        for i in range(len(shifts)-1, -1, -1):
            currShift = shifts[i] + prevShift
            res = shift(s[i], currShift) + res
            prevShift = currShift
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  One pass all elements

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Our result string
