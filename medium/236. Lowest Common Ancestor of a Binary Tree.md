## Question:

  
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the  [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow  **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given the following binary tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes `5` and `1` is `3.`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes `5` and `4` is `5`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Note:**

-   All of the nodes' values will be unique.
-   p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Recursion**

**Intuition**

The approach is pretty intuitive. Traverse the tree in a depth first manner. The moment you encounter either of the nodes  `p`  or  `q`, return some boolean flag. The flag helps to determine if we found the required nodes in any of the paths. The least common ancestor would then be the node for which both the subtree recursions return a  `True`  flag. It can also be the node which itself is one of  `p`  or  `q`  and for which one of the subtree recursions returns a  `True`  flag.

Let us look at the formal algorithm based on this idea.

**Algorithm**

1.  Start traversing the tree from the root node.
2.  If the current node itself is one of  `p`  or  `q`, we would mark a variable  `mid`  as  `True`  and continue the search for the other node in the left and right branches.
3.  If either of the left or the right branch returns  `True`, this means one of the two nodes was found below.
4.  If at any point in the traversal, any two of the three flags  `left`,  `right`  or  `mid`  become  `True`, this means we have found the lowest common ancestor for the nodes  `p`  and  `q`.

        self.ans = None
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        def recurse_tree(current_node):

            # If reached the end of a branch, return False.
            if not current_node:
                return False

            # Left Recursion
            left = recurse_tree(current_node.left)

            # Right Recursion
            right = recurse_tree(current_node.right)

            # If the current node is one of p or q
            mid = current_node == p or current_node == q

            # If any two of the three flags left, right or mid become True.
            if mid + left + right >= 2:
                self.ans = current_node

            # Return True if either of the three bool values is True.
            return mid or left or right

        # Traverse the tree
        recurse_tree(root)
        return self.ans
```
