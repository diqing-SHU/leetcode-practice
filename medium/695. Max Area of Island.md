# 695. Max Area of Island

  

## Question

You are given an  `m x n`  binary matrix  `grid`. An island is a group of  `1`'s (representing land) connected  **4-directionally**  (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The  **area**  of an island is the number of cells with a value  `1`  in the island.

Return  _the maximum  **area**  of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return  `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
-   `grid[i][j]`  is either  `0`  or  `1`.
## Solution

  

### Approach 1: DFS

#### Intuition
We can use dfs to explore all pieces of an island. Then update our max result.

After all islands are explored, we will have our answer.

On trick we can use here is to mark explored island as 0 (water) to save space

#### Algorithm
1. Loop through all positions, call DFS explore on islands
2. DFS explores all four neighbors, and mark counted islands as water to avoid revisiting.
3. Keep track of max result

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def exploreIsland(row, col):
            if row < 0 or row > len(grid)-1 or col < 0 or col > len(grid[0])-1:
                return 0
            if grid[row][col] == 1:
                grid[row][col] = 0
                return 1+exploreIsland(row-1, col)+exploreIsland(row+1, col)+exploreIsland(row, col-1)+exploreIsland(row, col+1)
            return 0
        res = 0
        for row in range(len(grid)):
            for col in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[row][col] == 1:
                    res = max(exploreIsland(row, col), res)
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n), all elements will be looped
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), our recursion stack
