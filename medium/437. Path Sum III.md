## Question:


You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    **5**   **-3**
   **/** **\**    **\**
  **3**   **2**   **11**
 / \   **\**
3  -2   **1**

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Brute Force**

#### 1.1 High level walk-through:

1.  (Define return) Define a global var:  `self.numOfPaths`  in the main function.
2.  (1st layer DFS) Use recursive traverse to go through each  `node`  (can be  **any order**: pre, in, post all fine).
3.  (2nd layer DFS) For each  `node`, walk all paths. If a path sum equals to the  `target`:  `self.numOfPaths += 1`
4.  Return result:  `return self.numOfPaths`


```python
class Solution(object):
    def pathSum(self, root, target):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type sum: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # define global return var
        self.numOfPaths = 0
        # 1st layer DFS to go through each node
        self.dfs(root, target)
        # return result
        return self.numOfPaths
    
    # define: traverse through the tree, at each treenode, call another DFS to test if a path sum include the answer
    def dfs(self, node, target):
        # exit condition
        if node is None:
            return 
        # dfs break down 
        self.test(node, target) # you can move the line to any order, here is pre-order
        self.dfs(node.left, target)
        self.dfs(node.right, target)
        
    # define: for a given node, DFS to find any path that sum == target, if find self.numOfPaths += 1
    def test(self, node, target):
        # exit condition
        if node is None:
            return
        if node.val == target:
            self.numOfPaths += 1
            
        # test break down
        self.test(node.left, target-node.val)
        self.test(node.right, target-node.val)

```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**

1.  Time complexity depends on the two DFS.
2.  1st layer DFS will always take  **O(n)**, due to here we will take each node out, there are in total  **n**  TreeNodes
3.  2nd layer DFS will take range from  **O(n)**  (single sided tree) to  **O(logn)**(balanced tree). This is due to here we are get all the paths from a given node. The length of path is proportional to the tree height.
4.  Therefore, the total time complexity is  **O(nlogn)**  to  **O(n^2)**.

**SC**

1.  Space complexity is O(1), due to there is no extra cache. However, for  **any recursive**  question, we need to think about  **stack overflow**, namely the recursion should not go too deep.
2.  Assume we have  **n**  TreeNodes in total, the tree height will vary from  **O(n)**  (single sided tree) to  **O(logn)**(balanced tree).
3.  The two DFS will go as deep as the tree height.

**Approach 2: Memorization of Path Sum**

#### 2.1 High level walk through

1.  In order to optimize from the brutal force solution, we will have to think of a clear way to memorize the intermediate result. Namely in the brutal force solution, we did a lot repeated calculation. For example  `1->3->5`, we calculated: 1, 1+3, 1+3+5, 3, 3+5, 5.
2.  This is a classical 'space and time tradeoff': we can create a dictionary (named  `cache`) which saves all the path sum (from root to current node) and their frequency.
3.  Again, we traverse through the tree, at each node, we can get the  `currPathSum`  (from root to current node). If within this path, there is a valid solution, then there must be a  `oldPathSum`  such that  `currPathSum - oldPathSum = target`.
4.  We just need to add the frequency of the  `oldPathSum`  to the result.
5.  During the DFS break down, we need to -1 in  `cache[currPathSum]`, because this path is not available in later traverse.
6.  Check the graph below for easy visualization.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def pathSum(self, root, target):
        # define global result and path
        self.result = 0
        cache = {0:1}
        
        # recursive to get result
        self.dfs(root, target, 0, cache)
        
        # return result
        return self.result
    
    def dfs(self, root, target, currPathSum, cache):
        # exit condition
        if root is None:
            return  
        # calculate currPathSum and required oldPathSum
        currPathSum += root.val
        oldPathSum = currPathSum - target
        # update result and cache
        self.result += cache.get(oldPathSum, 0)
        cache[currPathSum] = cache.get(currPathSum, 0) + 1
        
        # dfs breakdown
        self.dfs(root.left, target, currPathSum, cache)
        self.dfs(root.right, target, currPathSum, cache)
        # when move to a different branch, the currPathSum is no longer available, hence remove one. 
        cache[currPathSum] -= 1
```
  

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) as we just traverse once
  

SC:O(n) extra space
