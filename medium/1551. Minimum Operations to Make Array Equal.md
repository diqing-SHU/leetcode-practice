# 1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal

  

## Question:

  
You have an array  `arr`  of length  `n`  where  `arr[i] = (2 * i) + 1`  for all valid values of  `i`  (i.e.  `0 <= i < n`).

In one operation, you can select two indices  `x` and  `y`  where  `0 <= x, y < n`  and subtract  `1`  from  `arr[x]`  and add  `1`  to  `arr[y]` (i.e. perform  `arr[x] -=1` and  `arr[y] += 1`). The goal is to make all the elements of the array  **equal**. It is  **guaranteed**  that all the elements of the array can be made equal using some operations.

Given an integer  `n`, the length of the array. Return  _the minimum number of operations_  needed to make all the elements of arr equal.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** arr = [1, 3, 5]
First operation choose x = 2 and y = 0, this leads arr to be [2, 3, 4]
In the second operation choose x = 2 and y = 0 again, thus arr = [3, 3, 3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## Solution:
**Approach 1: 1 Pass**

After look in to the question. The minimum moves we need to make, to balance the values in the array, is to transfer value between pairs of maximum and minimum. The final state we want to achieve is all values are equal to mid value. 

Thus, we just need to calculate the target value and count moves needed in each pairs (going through half of the list)

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        mid, res = n//2, 0
        target = mid*2+1
        if n%2==0:
            target = (target+(mid-1)*2+1) //2
        for i in range(mid):
            curr = i*2+1
            res += target-curr
        return res
```

**Approach 2: Math**


All we need to do in this problem is to use some school math. There will be two cases we need to consider,  `odd`  and  `even`  n. Let us consider  `odd`  case first:

1.  **Odd**  case: consider  `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17`  to see the pattern. Then we need to make all numbers equal to  `9`. How many operations we need? For pair  `7,11`  we need  `2`  operations, for  `5,13`  we need  `4`  operation, then  `6`  and  `8`. In total we need  `2+4+6+8 = 20`  operations. How to calculate it in general case? If  `n = 2k + 1`, then we need to calculate  `2 + 4 + ... + 2k`, which is the sum of arithmetic progression and equal to  `k*(k+1) = (n*n-1)//4`.
2.  **Even**  case: consider  `1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15`  to see the pattern. Then we need to make all numbers equal to  `8`. We need  `1 + 3+ 5 + 7 = 16`  operations and in general case we need  `1 + 3 + ... + 2k-1 = k*k = n*n//4`  operations.

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
		return (n ** 2 - n % 2) // 4
```
We can write down it as one formula, using rounding (floor division operator).
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:```
		return n*n//4
```
