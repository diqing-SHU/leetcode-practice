# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

  

  

## Question:


Given a binary tree, return the  _vertical order_  traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position  `(X, Y)`, its left and right children respectively will be at positions  `(X-1, Y-1)`  and  `(X+1, Y-1)`.

Running a vertical line from  `X = -infinity`  to  `X = +infinity`, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing  `Y`  coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of  `X`  coordinate. Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/31/1236_example_1.PNG)

**Input:** [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
**Explanation:** 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/31/tree2.png)**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
**Output:** [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
**Explanation:** 
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.

**Note:**

1.  The tree will have between  1 and  `1000`  nodes.
2.  Each node's value will be between  `0`  and  `1000`.
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: 2 Pointers**
DFS with x and y parameters. Recursion is the easy part.
Use 2-d hash map to hold value. After that we population ans with the 2-d hash map.
```python
class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        keeper = {}
        self.discover(root, 0, 0, keeper)
        print(keeper)
        res = []
        smallest_x, largest_x = min(keeper.keys()), max(keeper.keys())
        for x in range(smallest_x, largest_x+1):
            same_x = []
            smallest_y, largest_y = min(keeper[x].keys()), max(keeper[x].keys())
            for y in reversed(range(smallest_y, largest_y+1)):
                if y not in keeper[x]: continue
                same_y = keeper[x][y]
                same_y.sort()
                same_x += same_y
            res.append(same_x)
        return res

    def discover(self, root: TreeNode, x: int, y: int, keeper: dict) -> None:
        if not root: return
        if x not in keeper: keeper[x] = {}
        if y not in keeper[x]: keeper[x][y] = []
        keeper[x][y].append(root.val)
        self.discover(root.left, x-1, y-1, keeper)
        self.discover(root.right, x+1, y-1, keeper)
```
