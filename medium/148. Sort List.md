## Question:

Given the  `head`  of a linked list, return  _the list after sorting it in  **ascending order**_.

**Follow up:**  Can you sort the linked list in  `O(n logn)`  time and  `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort_list_1.jpg)

**Input:** head = [4,2,1,3]
**Output:** [1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort_list_2.jpg)

**Input:** head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
**Output:** [-1,0,3,4,5]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 5 * 104]`.
-   `-105  <= Node.val <= 105`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Top-down divide and conquer**
Just apply merge sort with linked list. As we know it takes O(nlogn) to do merge sort.
```python
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        # init fast as head.next to avoid head.next.next == None situation
        fast, slow = head.next, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        start = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        l, r = self.sortList(head), self.sortList(start)
        return self.merge(l, r)
        
        
    def merge(self, l, r):
        if not l or not r:
            return l or r
        dummy = p = ListNode(0)
        while l and r:
            if l.val < r.val:
                p.next = l
                l = l.next
            else:
                p.next = r
                r = r.next
            p = p.next
        p.next = l or r
        return dummy.next
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(nlogn) Merge sort

**SC** 
O(nlogn) Our recursion stack also takes space

**Approach 2: Bottom-up merge sort**
Like N-Queens, a location is illuminated if a light is in its horizontal, vertical or oblique. Since we can use x, y , x-y, x+y to represent each of the situation. 

We can one pass the lamps to create our counter collections.
As long as any of the counter on corresponding index is greater than 0 (at least one light), its still illuminated. 
Then, we just need to remove light and reduce corresponding counter as we go through the queries.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        dummy = ListNode('s')
        dummy.next = head
        tmp = head
        length = 0
        while tmp:
            tmp = tmp.next
            length += 1
        step = 1
        while step<length:
            cur, tail = dummy.next, dummy
            while cur:
                left = cur
                right = self.split(left,step)
                cur = self.split(right, step)
                tail = self.merge2(left,right,tail)
            step <<= 1
        return dummy.next
    
    # merge 2 sorted lists, and append the result to head
    # return the tail
    def merge2(self, p1, p2, head):
        dummy = ListNode('#');p = dummy
        while p1 and p2:
            if p1.val <= p2.val:
                p.next = p1
                p1 = p1.next; p = p.next
            else:
                p.next = p2
                p2 = p2.next; p = p.next
        p.next = p1 or p2
        head.next = dummy.next
        while p.next: p = p.next
        return p

    # divide the linked list into two lists
    # first linked list contains n nodes
    # return the head of second linked list
    def split(self, head, n):
        for i in range(n-1): 
            if head: head = head.next
            else: break
        if not head: return None
        second = head.next
        head.next = None
        return second
```
