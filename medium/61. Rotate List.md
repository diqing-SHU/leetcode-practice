# 61. Rotate List

## Question

Given the  `head`  of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by  `k`  places.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
**Output:** [4,5,1,2,3]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)

**Input:** head = [0,1,2], k = 4
**Output:** [2,0,1]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 109`

## Solution

### Approach 1: 2 Pointers

#### Intuition

Use 2 pointers to locate the starting node, disconnect previous node, append head as next to the end of current end.

In case of too large k, we can recalculate minimum k required once we reached end the first time (get the length)

#### Algorithm

1. One pass to get length
2. Use two pointer to get to correct node
3. Break and return correct head

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head: return head
        p1, p2 = head, head
        dummy = res = ListNode(0)
        count = 0
        # First traverse, stop if we hit the end
        for i in range(k):
            count+=1
            if p2.next == None:
                p2 = head
                break
            else:
                p2 = p2.next
        # If stopped, recalculate k and traverse again
        if k > count:
            k = k%count
            for i in range(k):
                p2 = p2.next
        # 2 pointers
     # Stop one node earlier to disconnect
        while p2.next:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
        dummy.next = p1.next
        p1.next = None
        # Stop at last node
        while dummy.next:
            dummy = dummy.next
        # attach head
        dummy.next = head
        return res.next
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , can visit up to all nodes

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , constant extra space

### Approach 2: One Pointer

#### Intuition

Since we need to connect the tail anyways, we have to find the end/length. Might as well simplify our code to get length and connect end first.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass to get total length and connect tail to head
2. Move to the correct node and break
4. Return the new head after rotation

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        length = 1
        curr = head
        while curr.next:
            length+=1
            curr = curr.next
        # connect to head
        curr.next = head
        k %= length
        for i in range(length-k):
            curr = curr.next
        res = curr.next
        curr.next = None
        return res
```

Revisited and come up with similar code

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        length = 1
        curr = head
        while curr.next:
            length+=1
            curr = curr.next
        # connect to head
        curr.next = head
        k %= length
        for i in range(length-k):
            curr = curr.next
        res = curr.next
        curr.next = None
        return res
```

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , One pass for length
- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , Constant extra space
