## Question:


Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by  _k_  places, where  _k_  is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2
**Output:** 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
**Explanation:**
rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4
**Output:** `2->0->1->NULL`
**Explanation:**
rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL
rotate 3 steps to the right: `0->1->2->NULL`
rotate 4 steps to the right: `2->0->1->NULL`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: 2 Pointers**
Use 2 pointers to locate the starting node, disconnect previous node, append head as next to the end of current end.
In case of too large k, we can recalculate minimum k required once we reached end the first time (get the length)
```python
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head: return head
        p1, p2 = head, head
        dummy = res = ListNode(0)
        count = 0
        # First traverse, stop if we hit the end
        for i in range(k):
            count+=1
            if p2.next == None:
                p2 = head
                break
            else:
                p2 = p2.next
        # If stopped, recalculate k and traverse again
        if k > count:
            k = k%count
            for i in range(k):
                p2 = p2.next
        # 2 pointers
	    # Stop one node earlier to disconnect
        while p2.next:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
        dummy.next = p1.next
        p1.next = None
        # Stop at last node
        while dummy.next:
            dummy = dummy.next
        # attach head
        dummy.next = head
        return res.next
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**

O(n) can visit up to all nodes

**SC**

O(1) Constant extra space

**Approach 2: One Pointer**
Since we need to connect the tail anyways, we have to find the end/length. Might as well simplify our code to get length and connect end first.
```python
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head: return head
        p, length = head, 0
        # Get length
        while p.next:
            p = p.next
            length+=1
        length+=1
        # Connect head
        p.next = head
        # Get minimum k
        k = k%length
        # Stop one node ahead
        for i in range(length-k-1):
            head = head.next
        # reuse pointer to hold our answer and disconnect at the same time
        p, head.next = head.next, None
        return p
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) One pass for length

SC:O(1) Constant extra space
