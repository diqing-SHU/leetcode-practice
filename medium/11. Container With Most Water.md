# 11. Container With Most Water

## Question

You are given an integer array  `height`  of length  `n`. There are  `n`  vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the  `ith`  line are  `(i, 0)`  and  `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return  _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice**  that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = [1,1]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

## Solution

### Approach 1: 2 pointers + greedy

#### Intuition

The area is determined by two factors: distance between two indexes and the shorter height at the two indexes. Since we are looking for the max area, greedy seems like a good approach in this case.

We already know that max distance is between first and last element and we can narrow it down by moving either start or end. To complete our greedy approach, we need to move the pointer which will give us more potential for larger area.

Since the area is bounded by the shorter height, we should move the pointer at the shorter height. So that we are keeping the higher height to potentially have a better height next time.

#### Algorithm

1. Use two pointer to check ranges
2. Move the pointer at the shorter height
3. Return max area we can form on the way

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        start, end = 0, len(height)-1
        res = 0 
        while start < end:
            # update area
            currArea = min(height[start], height[end])*(end-start)
            res = max(res, currArea)
            # move our shortest edge
            if height[start]<=height[end]:
                start+=1
            else:
                end-=1
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , One pass the array

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , Constant extra space
