# 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

## Question

One way to serialize a binary tree is to use  **preorder traversal**. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as  `'#'`.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/pre-tree.jpg)

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string  `"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"`, where  `'#'`  represents a null node.

Given a string of comma-separated values  `preorder`, return  `true`  if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.

It is  **guaranteed**  that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character  `'#'`  representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid.

- For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as  `"1,,3"`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** preorder = "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** preorder = "1,#"
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** preorder = "9,#,#,1"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= preorder.length <= 104`
- `preorder`  consist of integers in the range  `[0, 100]`  and  `'#'`  separated by commas  `','`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Stack

#### Intuition

To validate a tree, we need to make sure each node has left and right child. Looking at the preorder we have, we need to validate bottom up from the leaves.

Since we are checking backwards, stack is the best data structure here. A leaf will has 2 '#' after it, So thats what we are checking.

To make life easier, we marked checked nodes as '#' to reuse the same logic.

#### Algorithm

1. Loop through preorder
2. Mark and reduce stack if we are able to
3. Check the stack in the end

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:
        preorderList = preorder.split(',')
        if len(preorderList)%2 != 1:
            return False
        stack = []
        for node in preorderList:
            stack.append(node)
            while len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-2] == stack[-1] == '#' and stack[-3] != '#':
                for i in range(3):
                    stack.pop()
                stack.append('#')
        return len(stack) == 1 and stack[0] == '#'
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, one pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, our stack
