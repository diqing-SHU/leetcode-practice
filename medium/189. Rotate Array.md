# 189. Rotate Array

## Question:


Given an array, rotate the array to the right by  _k_  steps, where _k_ is non-negative.

**Follow up:**

-   Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
-   Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
**Output:** [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
**Explanation:**
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
**Output:** [3,99,-1,-100]
**Explanation:** 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
-   `-231  <= nums[i] <= 231  - 1`
-   `0 <= k <= 105`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Brute Force**
Simply do k times of whole rotation in array
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        # speed up the rotation
        k %= len(nums)

        for i in range(k):
            previous = nums[-1]
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                nums[j], previous = previous, nums[j]
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(kn) 

**SC** 
O(1) No extra space

**Approach 2: Extra array**
With extra space, we can put the element directly into correct position.

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        a = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            a[(i + k) % n] = nums[i]
            
        nums[:] = a
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) One rotation

**SC** 
O(n) Extra array

---

**Approach 3: Cyclic Replacements**
Evolve from approach 2. Instead of the extra array, we simply try to put the element to its correct position while holding the replaced element in temp. However, if `n % k = 0` where `k = k % n` (since a value of `k` larger than `n` eventually leads to a `k` equivalent to `k % n`). We will be stuck in a loop. Thus, we need to go to next position until we are back to the original position
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        k %= n
        
        start = count = 0
        while count < n:
            current, prev = start, nums[start]
            while True:
                next_idx = (current + k) % n
                nums[next_idx], prev = prev, nums[next_idx]
                current = next_idx
                count += 1
                
                if start == current:
                    break
            start += 1
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) Even though we have `while` loop inside `for` loop, complexity will be `O(n)`:on each step we put at least one number to its proper place

**SC** 
O(1) No extra space
