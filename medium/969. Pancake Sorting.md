## Question:

Given an array of integers `A`, We need to sort the array performing a series of  **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

-   Choose an integer  `k`  where  `0 <= k < A.length`.
-   Reverse the sub-array  `A[0...k]`.

For example, if  `A = [3,2,1,4]`  and we performed a pancake flip choosing  `k = 2`, we reverse the sub-array  `[3,2,1]`, so  `A = [**1,2,3**,4]`  after the pancake flip at  `k = 2`.

Return  _an array of the k-values of the pancake flips_  that should be performed in order to sort  `A`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within  `10 * A.length`  flips will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** A = [3,2,4,1]
**Output:** [4,2,4,3]
**Explanation:** 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): A = [**1, 4, 2, 3**]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): A = [**4, 1**, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): A = [**3, 2, 1, 4**]
After 4th flip (k = 3): A = [**1, 2, 3**, 4], which is sorted.
Notice that we return an array of the chosen k values of the pancake flips.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** A = [1,2,3]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= A.length <= 100`
-   `1 <= A[i] <= A.length`
-   All integers in  `A`  are unique (i.e.  `A`  is a permutation of the integers from  `1`  to  `A.length`).
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Bubble sort**
Since every time we can flip 0 up to k elements. We can start by putting the largest to its correct position. Then don't worry about it.
```python
class Solution:
    def pancakeSort(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        sortedA = sorted(A)
        if sortedA == A:
            return res
        def flip(sublist, k):
            i = 0
            while i < k / 2:
                sublist[i], sublist[k-i-1] = sublist[k-i-1], sublist[i]
                i += 1
        for i in range(len(sortedA)-1,-1,-1):
            index = A.index(sortedA[i])
            # Only do flip if the value is not in position
            if index != i:
                # Flip the value to the head if necessary
                if index != 0:
                    res.append(index+1)
                    flip(A, index+1)
                # Now that the value is at the head, flip it to the bottom
                res.append(i+1)
                flip(A, i+1)
        return res
```
