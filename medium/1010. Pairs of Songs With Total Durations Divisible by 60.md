# 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

## Question

You are given a list of songs where the ith  song has a duration of  `time[i]`  seconds.

Return  _the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by_  `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices  `i`,  `j`  such that  `i < j`  with  `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** time = [30,20,150,100,40]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

**Example 2:**

**Input:** time = [60,60,60]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

## Solution

### Approach 1: 2 Sum

#### Intuition

This can be treated as a variant of 2sum question.

#### Algorithm

We can normalize the duration and use a hashmap to solve the problem.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        appearDict, res = {}, 0
        for duration in time:
            dividedDuration = duration%60
            if 60-dividedDuration in appearDict:
                res += appearDict[60-dividedDuration]
            if dividedDuration not in appearDict:
                appearDict[dividedDuration] = 0
            appearDict[dividedDuration] += 1
        if 0 in appearDict:
            res += appearDict[0]*(appearDict[0]-1)//2
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), one pass the array

- **Space Complexity:** O(n), our hashmap.
