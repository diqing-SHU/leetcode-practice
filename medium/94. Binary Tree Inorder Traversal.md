# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal


## Question:


Given a binary tree, return the  _preorder_  traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**

**Input:** `[1,null,2,3]`
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

**Output:** `[1,2,3]`

**Follow up:**  Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution:

**Approach 1: Iterative**
Use a stack LIFO.
Goes left first till we reach a leaf while append all the nodes. Then handle them and their right child (Inorder Traversal)
```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
	    stack, res, curr = [root], [], root
	    while stack and curr:
		    while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
	        node = stack.pop()
	        if node:
	            res.append(node.val)
	            curr = curr.right;
	    return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) The time complexity is O(n) because the recursive function is T(n)=2⋅T(n/2)+1.

SC:O(n) The worst case space required is O(n), and in the average case it's O(logn) where n is number of nodes.

**Approach 2: Recursive**
For inorder traversal, we can also apply DFS. Just append the val after we visit all lefts
```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        def dfs(node, res):
            if node:
                if node.left:
                    dfs(node.left, res)
                res.append(node.val)
                if node.right:
                    dfs(node.right, res)
        res = []
        dfs(root, res)
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) The time complexity is O(n) because the recursive function is T(n)=2⋅T(n/2)+1.

SC:O(n) The worst case space required is O(n), and in the average case it's O(logn) where n is number of nodes.

**Approach 3: Morris Traversal**
In this method, we have to use a new data structure-Threaded Binary Tree, and the strategy is as follows:

> Step 1: Initialize current as root
> 
> Step 2: While current is not NULL,
> 
> ```
> If current does not have left child
> 
>     a. Add current’s value
> 
>     b. Go to the right, i.e., current = current.right
> 
> Else
> 
>     a. In current's left subtree, make current the right child of the rightmost node
> 
>     b. Go to this left child, i.e., current = current.left
> 
> ```

For example:

```

          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   /
     4   5 6


```

First, 1 is the root, so initialize 1 as current, 1 has left child which is 2, the current's left subtree is

```
         2
        / \
       4   5

```

So in this subtree, the rightmost node is 5, then make the current(1) as the right child of 5. Set current = cuurent.left (current = 2). The tree now looks like:

```
         2
        / \
       4   5
            \
             1
              \
               3
              /
             6

```

For current 2, which has left child 4, we can continue with thesame process as we did above

```
        4
         \
          2
           \
            5
             \
              1
               \
                3
               /
              6

```

then add 4 because it has no left child, then add 2, 5, 1, 3 one by one, for node 3 which has left child 6, do the same as above. Finally, the inorder taversal is [4,2,5,1,6,3].

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        curr, res = root, []
        while curr:
	        # if have left subtree
            if curr.left:
                pre = curr.left
                # find most right of the left subtree
                while pre.right:
                    pre = pre.right
                # attach curr to the right of left subtree
                pre.right = curr
                # store curr node
                temp = curr
                # move curr to the top of the new tree
                curr = curr.left
                # let original curr left be None, avoid infinite loops
                temp.left = None
            else:
                res.append(curr.val)
                # move to next right node
                curr = curr.right
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) To prove that the time complexity is O(n), the biggest problem lies in finding the time complexity of finding the predecessor nodes of all the nodes in the binary tree. Intuitively, the complexity is O(nlogn), because to find the predecessor node for a single node related to the height of the tree. But in fact, finding the predecessor nodes for all nodes only needs O(n) time. Because a binary Tree with n nodes has n−1 edges, the whole processing for each edges up to 2 times, one is to locate a node, and the other is to find the predecessor node. So the complexity is O(n).

SC:O(n) Still need the space to answer the question. But it eliminates the need for extra space(either recursive call stack or stack in iterative method).
