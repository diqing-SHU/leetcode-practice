# 795. Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum

## Question

We are given an array  `nums`  of positive integers, and two positive integers  `left`  and  `right`  (`left <= right`).

Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least  `left`  and at most  `right`.

**Example:**
**Input:** 
nums = [2, 1, 4, 3]
left = 2
right = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].

**Note:**

-   `left`,  `right`, and  `nums[i]`  will be an integer in the range  `[0, 109]`.
-   The length of  `nums`  will be in the range of  `[1, 50000]`.
## Solution

  

### Approach 1: Sliding window

#### Intuition
We can use sliding window to tackle this question. Add the length to our ans whenever we have a new range. Let us iterate through numbers and keep index of last number which is `>= L` and index of last number, which is `> R`. Then, we can quickly calculate number of subarrays with bounded maximum which ends on symbol with index `i`: in our window at least one number `>= L`, no numbers `> R`, so we calculate`L_ind - R_ind`. Note, that this number can never be negative, because if `num > R` then `num >= L` since L <= R.

#### Algorithm
1. One pass the array while keep left and right pointer
2. Update bound index based on curr value
3. Add length of the new range

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayBoundedMax(self, A, L, R):
        L_ind, R_ind, ans = -1, -1, 0
        for i, num in enumerate(A):
	        # L_ind will always be updated if R_ind is updated
	        # which means L_ind >= R_ind
            if num >= L: L_ind = i
            if num > R:  R_ind = i
            ans += L_ind - R_ind
        return ans
```
More standard, easy-to-understand sliding window
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayBoundedMax(self, nums: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> int:
        i = 0 # start of window
        j = 0 # end of window
        n = len(nums)
        # Perfectly Bounded Subarray means that the elements are in range [left,right] and present in the current window [i,j].
        count = 0 # number of element in the perfectly bounded subarray
        ans = 0 # number of subarray satisfying the required condition
        
        while i<=j and j<n:
	        # in range, count and increase prev range
            if left <= nums[j] and nums[j] <= right:
                ans += (j - i + 1)
                count = (j - i + 1)
            # shrink the window, rebuild prev range
            elif right < nums[j]:
                i = j + 1
                count = 0
            # append prev range
            else:
                ans += count
            j += 1
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n), One pass the array
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(1), Constant extra space
