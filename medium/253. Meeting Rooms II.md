# 253. Meeting Rooms II

## Question

Given an array of meeting time intervals  `intervals`  where  `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return  _the minimum number of conference rooms required_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `0 <= starti  < endi  <= 106`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Heap

#### Intuition

Think of scheduling ranges as time goes. We can empty a room and use it for later as soon as one meeting happening finishes(end time is in the past). The structure to use here would be priority queue(heap for best performance)

#### Algorithm

1. Sort the intervals based on start time
2. Keep a sort of end times for ongoing events
3. Remove past events before we put current events in
4. Return the max for events that we have in the process

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        ongoingEnds, res = [], 0
        for interval in intervals:
            (start, end) = interval
            while len(ongoingEnds) > 0 and ongoingEnds[0] <= start:
                heapq.heappop(ongoingEnds)
            heapq.heappush(ongoingEnds, end)
            
            res = max(len(ongoingEnds), res)
        return res
            
                    
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(nlogn)` , sort takes O(nlogn) and we have a O(n) loop with O(logn) heap operation

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , Our heap size can go up to n

### Approach 2: Events array

#### Intuition

Think of a start and end of range as events. A start event will start a meeting while end will end a meeting. We just need to change the number of ongoing meetings if we are going through the events by time

#### Algorithm

1. Create start and end event array and sort them
2. Loop through the two events array based on time (smaller happens first. If same, prioritize end meeting first since its allowed)
3. Return the max ongoing events we can have

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        startEvents, endEvents = sorted([interval[0] for interval in intervals]), sorted([interval[1] for interval in intervals])
        ongoingEvents, res = 0, 0
        startPointer, endPointer = 0, 0
        while startPointer < len(intervals) and endPointer < len(intervals):
            start, end = startEvents[startPointer], endEvents[endPointer]
            if start >= end:
                ongoingEvents -= 1
                endPointer+=1
            else:
                ongoingEvents += 1
                startPointer+=1
            res = max(ongoingEvents, res)
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(nlogn)` , Sort is the bottle neck. Then just one pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, Our events array
