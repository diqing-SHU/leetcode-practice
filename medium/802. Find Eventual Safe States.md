# 802. Find Eventual Safe States

## Question

There is a directed graph of  `n`  nodes with each node labeled from  `0`  to  `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a  **0-indexed**  2D integer array  `graph`  where  `graph[i]`  is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node  `i`, meaning there is an edge from node  `i`  to each node in  `graph[i]`.

A node is a  **terminal node**  if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a  **safe node**  if every possible path starting from that node leads to a  **terminal node**.

Return  _an array containing all the  **safe nodes**  of the graph_. The answer should be sorted in  **ascending**  order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
**Output:** [2,4,5,6]
**Explanation:** The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
**Output:** [4]
**Explanation:**
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.

**Constraints:**

- `n == graph.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= graph[i].length <= n`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1`
- `graph[i]`  is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The graph may contain self-loops.
- The number of edges in the graph will be in the range  `[1, 4 * 104]`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: BFS

#### Intuition

Beyond a normal BFS. We need to mark visited node with extra states. An array is idea to do so

#### Algorithm

1. BFS from the start
2. We mark visited as unsafe so that we can stop if we loop back
3. If we make it to a safe end. we need to update our assumptions back to safe

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        def dfs(start):
         # Base cases
            if state[start] == 1:
                return True
            if state[start] == -1:
                return False
            res = True
            # We mark start as not safe so
            # we will stop if we are back
            state[start] = -1
            for to in graph[start]:
                res = res and dfs(to)
            if res:
             # Our assumption is wrong
             # Mark start back as safe
                state[start] = 1
            return res
        res = []
        state = []
        for to in graph:
            if len(to) > 0:
                state.append(0)
            else:
                state.append(1)
        for index in range(len(graph)):
            if dfs(index):
                res.append(index)
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` BFS

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` to keep track of our states
