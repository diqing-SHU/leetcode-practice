# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

## Question

Given a binary tree  `root`, a node  _X_  in the tree is named **good**  if in the path from root to  _X_  there are no nodes with a value  _greater than_  X.

Return the number of  **good**  nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)**

**Input:** root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Nodes in blue are **good**.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)**

**Input:** root = [3,3,null,4,2]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Root is considered as **good**.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between  `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: DFS

#### Intuition

As we can see, by the definition of good node, we need the max value from root to node in order to determine whether the node should be counted in as good node.

#### Algorithm

1. DFS all the node
2. Carry prevMax in the path and use that to determine whether to count current node as good node.
3. Bottom up counts from the leaves.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        def dfs(node, currMax):
            if node:
                if currMax <= node.val:
                    return 1+dfs(node.left, node.val)+dfs(node.right, node.val)
                return dfs(node.left, currMax)+dfs(node.right, currMax)
            return 0
        return dfs(root, root.val)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, All nodes are visited

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(logn)`, the height of recursion call stack
