# 792. Number of Matching Subsequences

## Question

Given a string  `s`  and an array of strings  `words`, return  _the number of_  `words[i]`  _that is a subsequence of_  `s`.

A  **subsequence**  of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example,  `"ace"`  is a subsequence of  `"abcde"`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `s`  and  `words[i]`  consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Binary search

#### Intuition

Let `n` be length of `s` and `m` be total length of all chars in words. Then we can precompute all places for each symbol in `s` and then use binary search to find the first occurance (after current ind -> last char index + 1).

#### Algorithm

1. Collect all char/index info into a dict
2. Do binary search on the char index array based on currIndex

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        def isSubseq(word):
            curr = 0
            for char in word:
                ind = bisect_left(places[char], curr)
                if ind >= len(places[char]):
                    return False
                curr = places[char][ind] + 1
            return True
        
        places = defaultdict(list)
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            places[char].append(i)
        return sum(isSubseq(word) for word in words)  
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(m*log n + n), because we do at most `m` binary searches and we need `O(n)` to evaluate `places`
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), Our places dict
