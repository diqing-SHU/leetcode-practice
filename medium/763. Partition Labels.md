# 763. Partition Labels

## Question:
A string  `S`  of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
**Output:** [9,7,8]
**Explanation:**
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

**Note:**

-   `S`  will have length in range  `[1, 500]`.
-   `S`  will consist of lowercase English letters (`'a'`  to  `'z'`) only.
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Interval**
We loop first to get all interval. Then we do greedy on all char intervals to get maximum amount of intervals that doesn't overlap.
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        charDict = {}
        # First we loop to get all the intervals for all appearing chars
        # The key will be char in appearing orders
        for i in range(len(S)):
            if S[i] in charDict:
                charDict[S[i]][1] = i
            else:
                charDict[S[i]] = [i,i]
        prev = None
        res = []
        for key in charDict:
	        # If we are at second or further interval (have prev)
            if prev:
	            # If prev and current don't overlap
                if prev[1] < charDict[key][0]:
	                # We have one interval for answer here
	                # and get ready for next interval
                    res.append(prev[1]-prev[0]+1)
                    prev = charDict[key]
                # If overlap, we modify prev to include current
                elif prev[1] < charDict[key][1]:
                        prev[1] = charDict[key][1]
            else:
	            # This is to skip first one
                prev = charDict[key]
        # If we have any prev value, we need to process the last one
        # Since there is no more next interval
        if prev:
            res.append(prev[1]-prev[0]+1)
        return res
```

**Approach 2: Greedy**
Same idea as the interval solution. But more elegant with less usage of space. We only need end position for each char. And we compare 
```python
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
        j = anchor = 0
        ans = []
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            j = max(j, last[c])
            if i == j:
                ans.append(i - anchor + 1)
                anchor = i + 1
            
        return ans
```
