## Question:

Given  _n_  pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given  _n_  = 3, a solution set is:

[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Brute Force**
We can generate all 2^2n sequences of `'('` and `')'` characters. Then, we will check if each one is valid.
To generate all sequences, we use a recursion. All sequences of length  `n`  is just  `'('`  plus all sequences of length  `n-1`, and then  `')'`  plus all sequences of length  `n-1`.

To check whether a sequence is valid, we keep track of  `balance`, the net number of opening brackets minus closing brackets. If it falls below zero at any time, or doesn't end in zero, the sequence is invalid - otherwise it is valid.
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        def generate(A = []):
            if len(A) == 2*n:
                if valid(A):
                    ans.append("".join(A))
            else:
                A.append('(')
                generate(A)
                A.pop()
                A.append(')')
                generate(A)
                A.pop()

        def valid(A):
            bal = 0
            for c in A:
                if c == '(': bal += 1
                else: bal -= 1
                if bal < 0: return False
            return bal == 0

        ans = []
        generate()
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(2^(2n)*n^). For each of 2^(2n)*n^ sequences, we need to create and validate the sequence, which takes O(n) work.

**SC** 
O(2^(2n)*n^) Naively, every sequence could be valid.

**Approach 2: Backtracking**
Instead of adding  `'('`  or  `')'`  every time as in  [Approach 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/solution/#approach-1-brute-force), let's only add them when we know it will remain a valid sequence. We can do this by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets we have placed so far.

We can start an opening bracket if we still have one (of  `n`) left to place. And we can start a closing bracket if it would not exceed the number of opening brackets.

Our complexity analysis rests on understanding how many elements there are in `generateParenthesis(n)`. This analysis is outside the scope of this article, but it turns out this is the `n`-th Catalan number ![\dfrac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.download?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%201%7D%5Cbinom%7B2n%7D%7Bn%7D), which is bounded asymptotically by  ![\dfrac{4^n}{n\sqrt{n}}nn​4n](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.download?%5Cdfrac%7B4%5En%7D%7Bn%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D)​.
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        ans = []
        def backtrack(S = '', left = 0, right = 0):
	        # Base case to append and stop
            if len(S) == 2 * n:
                ans.append(S)
                return
            # we can still open new bracket
            if left < n:
                backtrack(S+'(', left+1, right)
            # we are valid to close one
            if right < left:
                backtrack(S+')', left, right+1)

        backtrack()
        return ans
```

**Approach 3: Closure Number**
To enumerate something, generally we would like to express it as a sum of disjoint subsets that are easier to count.

Consider the  _closure number_  of a valid parentheses sequence  `S`: the least  `index >= 0`  so that  `S[0], S[1], ..., S[2*index+1]`  is valid. Clearly, every parentheses sequence has a unique  _closure number_. We can try to enumerate them individually.

For each closure number `c`, we know the starting and ending brackets must be at index `0` and `2*c + 1`. Then, the `2*c` elements between must be a valid sequence, plus the rest of the elements must be a valid sequence.
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        if n == 0: return ['']
        ans = []
        for c in range(n):
            for left in self.generateParenthesis(c):
                for right in self.generateParenthesis(n-1-c):
                    ans.append('({}){}'.format(left, right))
        return ans
```
