## Question:
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an  _m_  x  _n_  matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

-   Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
-   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 13
**Output:** false
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Binary Search**
We can treat the whole 2d matrix as a sorted array of integers. Since its sorted, we should binary search instead of linear search.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        if not matrix or target is None:
            return False

        rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        low, high = 0, rows * cols - 1
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            num = matrix[mid // cols][mid % cols]

            if num == target:
                return True
            elif num < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        return False
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(logn). We are doing binary search

**SC** 
O(1) Constant extra space
