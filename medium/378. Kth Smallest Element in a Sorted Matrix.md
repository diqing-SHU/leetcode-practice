# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

## Question

Given an  `n x n`  `matrix`  where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, return  _the_  `kth`  _smallest element in the matrix_.

Note that it is the  `kth`  smallest element  **in the sorted order**, not the  `kth`  **distinct**  element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,**13**,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
**Output:** -5

**Constraints:**

- `n == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `-109  <= matrix[i][j] <= 109`
- All the rows and columns of  `matrix`  are  **guaranteed**  to be sorted in  **non-decreasing order**.
- `1 <= k <= n2`

## Solution

### Approach 1: ##### Binary search

#### Intuition

The idea is for number `X` find number of elements which are less or equal than `X`, which can be done in `O(n)`, idea is similar to problem **240: Search a 2D Matrix II**: we can start with the top right element and move only down and to the left, counting number of elements `<X` in each row. We start with the smallest and the biggest elements in our table and do binary search, each time asking question: is number of elements `< X` is more than `k`? We do binary search and stop when `end` become equal to `beg`.

#### Algorithm

1. Binary search on value ranges
2. Move left or right based on the number of elements smaller than value
3. Return the lower bond till done searching

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        n, beg, end = len(matrix), matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]
        
        def check(m):
            i, j, cnt = 0, n-1, 0
            for i in range(n):
                while j >= 0 and matrix[i][j] > m: j -= 1
                cnt += (j + 1)
            return cnt
         
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if check(mid) < k:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
                
        return beg
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(A))`, where `A` is difference between maximum and minimum values in our matrix.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, Constant extra space
