# 151. Reverse Words in a String

## Question

Given an input string  `s`, reverse the order of the  **words**.

A  **word**  is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The  **words**  in  `s`  will be separated by at least one space.

Return  _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note**  that  `s`  may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "the sky is blue"
**Output:** "blue is sky the"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "  hello world  "
**Output:** "world hello"
**Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "a good   example"
**Output:** "example good a"
**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
**Output:** "Alice Loves Bob"

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "Alice does not even like bob"
**Output:** "bob like even not does Alice"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s`  contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces  `' '`.
- There is  **at least one**  word in  `s`.

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?

## Solution

### Approach 1: One pass

#### Intuition

We just need to one pass all words and build results with words in reverse order

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all chars
2. Keep track of word and add to result once we have word while encounter space
3. Check if we have last word as well

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        p, res, word = 0, '', ''
        while p < len(s):
            # skip space
            if s[p] == ' ':
                if word != '':
                    if res != '':
                        res = ' ' + res
                    res = word + res
                word = ''
            else:
                word+=s[p]
            p+=1
        
        if word != '':
            if res != '':
                res = ' ' + res
            res = word + res
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`,  One pass all chars

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, to store res and words

### Approach 2: Two pointers

#### Intuition

In Python, string is immutable. So we cant perform in-place action. But we can use array to demo the idea. Basically, we trim the string, then reverse it, then reverse each word again

#### Algorithm

1. We traverse  `chars`  with two pointers and rewrite symbols in the beginning.
2. Cut our  `chars`, removing last elements (in my code it is not really inplace, but you can use  `del`  to do it in place)
3. Reverse list using  `chars.reverse()`.
4. Use two pointers to reverse each word.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s):       
        chars = [t for t in s]
        slow, n = 0, len(s)
        for fast in range(n):
            if chars[fast] != " " or (fast > 0 and chars[fast] == " " and chars[fast-1] != " "):
                chars[slow] = chars[fast]
                slow += 1
                
        if slow == 0: return ""       
        chars = chars[:slow-1] if chars[-1] == " " else chars[:slow]
        chars.reverse()
        
        slow, m = 0, len(chars)
        for fast in range(m + 1):
            if fast == m or chars[fast] == " ":
                chars[slow:fast] = chars[slow:fast][::-1]
                slow = fast + 1
                
        return "".join(chars)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, One pass

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`, In place operation(Other than creating the array)
