# 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

## Question

Given an n-ary tree, return the  _level order_  traversal of its nodes' values.

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
**Output:** [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
**Output:** [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]

**Constraints:**

- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to  `1000`
- The total number of nodes is between  `[0, 104]`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Iterative BFS

#### Intuition

Normal BFS. Since we are using list, we need to be careful about the ordering for each level.

#### Algorithm

1. Proccess through all nodes level by level
2. Prepare next level while we are working on current level

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
        toDoList, nextLevel, res, currLevel = [root], [], [], []
        while len(toDoList) > 0:
            curr = toDoList.pop()
            currLevel.append(curr.val)
            for child in curr.children:
             # We should use queue instead of list(stack)
                nextLevel = [child]+nextLevel
            if len(toDoList) == 0:
                currI = 0
                res.append(currLevel)
                currLevel, nextLevel, toDoList = [], [], nextLevel
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all nodes are visited

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all nodes values are stored

### Approach 2: Recursion DFS

#### Intuition

If we take recursive approach, we are essentially running a DFS. With a level param, we can output the results as a level-wise travesal.

#### Algorithm

1. DFS through the nodes
2. Append node val to corresponding level
3. Nodes are visited in a in-order traversal. So the order will be correct level-wise.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[List[int]]:
        def dfs(node, level):
            if node:
                while len(res)-1 < level:
                    res.append([])
                res[level].append(node.val)
                for child in node.children:
                    dfs(child, level+1)
        res = []
        dfs(root, 0)
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all nodes are visited

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all nodes values are stored
