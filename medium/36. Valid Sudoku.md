# 36. Valid Sudoku

## Question

Determine if a `9 x 9`  Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9`  without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3`  sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the **5** in the top left corner being modified to **8**. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]`  is a digit or  `'.'`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: HashMap

#### Intuition

Basically run row, col and square check for all numbers in the Sudoku. To reduce lookup time, we should put visited numbers in hash map.

#### Algorithm

1. Run check on every number
2. Store the visited number to save lookup time

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        def validRow(row, col):
            currNum = board[row][col]
            if col in RowSet:
                if currNum in RowSet[col]:
                    return False
            else:
                RowSet[col] = set()
            RowSet[col].add(currNum)
            return True
        def validCol(row, col):
            currNum = board[row][col]
            if row in ColSet:
                if currNum in ColSet[row]:
                    return False
            else:
                ColSet[row] = set()
            ColSet[row].add(currNum)
            return True
        def validSquare(row, col):
            currNum = board[row][col]
            startRow, startCol = row//3, col//3
            if (startRow, startCol) in SquareSet:
                if currNum in SquareSet[(startRow, startCol)]:
                    return False
            else:
                SquareSet[(startRow, startCol)] = set()
            SquareSet[(startRow, startCol)].add(currNum)
            return True
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        RowSet, ColSet, SquareSet = {}, {}, {}
        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if board[row][col] != '.':
                    if not validRow(row, col):
                        return False
                    if not validCol(row, col):
                        return False
                    if not validSquare(row, col):
                        return False
        return True
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all numbers are visited once worst case

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, to store all visited nodes in hashmap
