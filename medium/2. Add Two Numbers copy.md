## Question:

  
  
There are several cards **arranged in a row**, and each card has an associated number of points The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly  `k`  cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array  `cardPoints`  and the integer  `k`, return the  _maximum score_  you can obtain.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
**Output:** 55
**Explanation:** You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** cardPoints = [1,1000,1], k = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You cannot take the card in the middle. Your best score is 1. 

**Example 5:**

**Input:** cardPoints = [1,79,80,1,1,1,200,1], k = 3
**Output:** 202

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
-   `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
-   `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

## Solution:

### Approach 1: One Pass

#### Intuition
Take another look at the question. We trim off `k` numbers from either start or end, which left us with a continuous subarray of length `n-k`.

#### Algorithm
Thus, we just need to one pass all the subarrays we have and get the minimum sum among them (in order to get maximum of the rest of array, as the total sum is fixed)

Keep a sliding window of the sum to save time.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, cardPoints: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # we are trying to max removed num sum
        # in other word, min sum of remain contious subarray
        # the subarray will always be k lengthed
        remainingLength, totalSum = len(cardPoints)-k, sum(cardPoints)
        if remainingLength == 0:
            return totalSum
        currSum = sum(cardPoints[:remainingLength])
        minRemaining = currSum
        for newEnd in range(remainingLength, len(cardPoints)):
            # update our sum
            currSum = currSum - cardPoints[newEnd-remainingLength] + cardPoints[newEnd]
            minRemaining = min(currSum, minRemaining)
        return totalSum - minRemaining
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n), one pass the array

  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant extra space
