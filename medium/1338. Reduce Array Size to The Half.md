# 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half

## Question

Given an array  `arr`. You can choose a set of integers and remove all the occurrences of these integers in the array.

Return  _the minimum size of the set_  so that  **at least**  half of the integers of the array are removed.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has size greater than half of the size of the old array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [1,9]
**Output:** 1

**Example 4:**

**Input:** arr = [1000,1000,3,7]
**Output:** 1

**Example 5:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `arr.length`  is even.
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Sort

#### Intuition

Start removing with largest frequency. And keep removing until at least half of elements are removed.

We can sort to avoid finding max all the time

#### Algorithm

1. Count appearance of numbers
2. Sort based on the appearance decreasingly
3. One pass the sorted Counter til we have a solution

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        arrCounter = Counter(arr)
        removedCount, target, res = 0, len(arr)//2, 0
        for num, count in sorted(arrCounter.items(), key=lambda item: -item[1]):
            removedCount+=count
            res+=1
            if removedCount>= target:
                return res
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(nlogn)`, sort is the bottleneck
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, our Counter and sorted Counter

### Approach 2: Bucket Sort

#### Intuition

Since our frequency cant go over the size of the arr (which is bound by 100000).

A max of 100001 buckets will be enough in this case.

#### Algorithm

1. Start with empty Union Find data structure
2. Union connected points in Union Find data structure as water level raises
3. return answer once top-left and bottom-right points to same value (connected)

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        cnt = Counter(arr)
        frequencies = list(cnt.values())
        maxFreq = max(frequencies)
        bucket = [0] * (maxFreq + 1)
        for freq in frequencies:
            bucket[freq] += 1

        ans, removed, half = 0, 0, len(arr) // 2
        freq = maxFreq
        while removed < half:
            ans += 1
            while bucket[freq] == 0: freq -= 1
            removed += freq
            bucket[freq] -= 1
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` Bucket sort only takes O(n)
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, Our buckets
