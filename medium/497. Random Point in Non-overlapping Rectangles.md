## Question:

Given a list of  **non-overlapping** axis-aligned rectangles  `rects`, write a function  `pick`  which randomly and uniformily picks an  **integer point**  in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

1.  An  **integer point** is a point that has integer coordinates.
2.  A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is **included**  in the space covered by the rectangles.
3.  `i`th rectangle =  `rects[i]`  = `[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, where  `[x1, y1]` are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and  `[x2, y2]` are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
4.  length and width of each rectangle does not exceed  `2000`.
5.  `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
6.  `pick`  return a point as an array of integer coordinates `[p_x, p_y]`
7.  `pick`  is called at most  `10000` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"] [[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
**Output:** [null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"] [[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
**Output:** [null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles  `rects`.  `pick` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
**Approach 1: Weighted Probability**
All rectangles are not overlapping, so the probability of a possible point land in each rectangle can be represented as `area/total area`. Thus, we can use the weight to choose one rectangle and then generate a point in that rectangle.
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, rects: List[List[int]]):
        self.areaWeight, self.totalArea = {}, 0
        for rect in rects:
	        # +1 to include points at edges
            self.totalArea += (rect[3]-rect[1]+1)*(rect[2]-rect[0]+1)
            self.areaWeight[self.totalArea] = rect
            
    def pick(self) -> List[int]:
        if self.totalArea == 0:
            return None
        randWeight = self.totalArea*random.random()
        for areaBound in self.areaWeight:
            if randWeight <= areaBound:
                return [randint(self.areaWeight[areaBound][0], self.areaWeight[areaBound][2]), randint(self.areaWeight[areaBound][1], self.areaWeight[areaBound][3])]


# Your StreamChecker object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StreamChecker(words)
# param_1 = obj.query(letter)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**
O(n) Create the weight dict and go over the weight dict to generate.

**SC**

O(n) Store the weight dict
O(1) for pick

**Approach 2: Improve `pick` with Binary Search**
Same idea but apply binary search on pick
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, rects: List[List[int]]):
        w = [(x2-x1+1)*(y2-y1+1) for x1,y1,x2,y2 in rects]
        self.weights = [i/sum(w) for i in accumulate(w)]
        self.rects = rects

    def pick(self) -> List[int]:
        n_rect = bisect.bisect(self.weights, random.random())
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.rects[n_rect] 
        return [random.randint(x1, x2),random.randint(y1, y2)]
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**
O(n) to generate weights
O(log(n)) For pick now

**SC**
O(n) Store the weight dict
O(1) for pick
