# 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

## Question

Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return  _the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees_. Since the answer may be too large, return it  **modulo**  `109  + 7`.

**Note**  that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
**Output:** 110
**Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
**Output:** 90
**Explanation:** Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
**Output:** 1025

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = [1,1]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[2, 5 * 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 104`

## Solution

### Approach 1: DFS + Memorization

#### Intuition

To split binary tree, we can can do at any edges. Since the sum of the tree from root is fixed. If we have sum for subtree at child node of breaking edge, we can get the sum for the nodes left by subtract the subtree sum.

In other words, if we have all the subtree sums, we can one pass and get the max product.

#### Algorithm

1. DFS the tree and memorize all subtree sums
2. Use the equation to get all possible product with subtree sums
3. Keep track of max product

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, root):
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0
            ans = dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right) + node.val
            res.append(ans)
            return ans
        
        res = []
        dfs(root)
        sum_all = max(res)
        return max(i*(sum_all-i) for i in res) % (10**9 + 7)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)`, all nodes are visited once

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)`, to store all node sums
