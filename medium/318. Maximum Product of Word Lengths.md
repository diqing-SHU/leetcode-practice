# 318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths

  

## Question
Given a string array  `words`, return  _the maximum value of_  `length(word[i]) * length(word[j])`  _where the two words do not share common letters_. If no such two words exist, return  `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The two words can be "ab", "cd".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** No such pair of words.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= words.length <= 1000`
-   `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
-   `words[i]`  consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

  

### Approach 1: Bitmask

#### Intuition
Since we consider two words redundant if they have same character. We can actually use state of 26 characters and length to represent a word. For redundant words, we should keep track of max length. 

Let `d[word]` be bitmask of word. For example for word `aaabe` we will have mask `...10011`, here I for simplicity show only the last part, all other elements are zero. We have `1` in the end, because we have `a` in our word, we have `1` as next elements, because we have `b`, then we have `0`, because we do not have `c` and so on.

Other than that, we still need to do comparison between each two of all the unique max-len words

#### Algorithm
1.  Compute all masks for all words, we will use  `d[word] |= 1<<(ord(l) - 97)`  for this, where  `97`  is code of symbol  `a`. Also we use  `|`  (or) here to update zero-elements, but if we have one-elements, they will not change.
2.  For every pair of words check if  `d[w1] & d[w2] == 0`, this is condition that pair of words will not have any intersections and update our  `ans`  if they not.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        d, ans = defaultdict(int), 0
        for word in words:
            for l in word:
                d[word] |= 1<<(ord(l) - 97)
                
        for w1, w2 in combinations(d.keys(), 2):
            if d[w1] & d[w2] == 0: 
                ans = max(ans, len(w1)*len(w2))
                
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n*s) + O(n^2), generate all bitmask + nested loops
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), our mask dict
