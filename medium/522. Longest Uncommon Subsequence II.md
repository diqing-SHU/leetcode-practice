# 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II

## Question

Given an array of strings  `strs`, return  _the length of the  **longest uncommon subsequence**  between them_. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return  `-1`.

An  **uncommon subsequence**  between an array of strings is a string that is a  **subsequence of one string but not the others**.

A  **subsequence**  of a string  `s`  is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from  `s`.

- For example,  `"abc"`  is a subsequence of  `"aebdc"`  because you can delete the underlined characters in  `"aebdc"`  to get  `"abc"`. Other subsequences of  `"aebdc"`  include  `"aebdc"`,  `"aeb"`, and  `""`  (empty string).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 50`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 10`
- `strs[i]`  consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Brute force

#### Intuition

Since the input size is very small. We can actually solve this with brute force.

We can use bit mask to make generating all subsequence easier.

#### Algorithm

1. Loop through word
2. Generate all subsequence for the word and store unique ones into hashmap
3. Check the hashmap in the end

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findLUSlength(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        # O(2^k)
        def generateBitmasks(n):
            bitmasks = []
            for i in range(2**n, 2**(n + 1)):
                # generate bitmask, from 0..00 to 1..11
                bitmasks.append(bin(i)[3:])
            return bitmasks
        # O(k)
        def useBitmask(word, bitmask):
            res = ''
            for i, bit in enumerate(bitmask):
                if bit == '1':
                    res+=word[i]
            return res
        LusDict = {}
        # O(n)
        for word in strs:
            currSet = set()
            # use bit map
            bitmasks = generateBitmasks(len(word))
            for bitmask in bitmasks:
                currSet.add(useBitmask(word, bitmask))
            for subsequence in currSet:
                if subsequence not in LusDict:
                    LusDict[subsequence] = 0
                LusDict[subsequence] += 1
        res = []
        for subsequence in LusDict:
            if LusDict[subsequence] == 1:
                while len(res) <= len(subsequence):
                    res.append(0)
                res[len(subsequence)] += 1
        return len(res) - 1
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(2^k * k * n)`, time break down in the comments

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(2^k * n)`, our dict size
