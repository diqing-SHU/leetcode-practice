## Question:

Return all  **non-negative**  integers of length  `N`  such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is  `K`.

Note that  **every**  number in the answer  **must not**  have leading zeros  **except**  for the number  `0`  itself. For example,  `01`  has one leading zero and is invalid, but  `0`  is valid.

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 3, K = 7
**Output:** [181,292,707,818,929]
**Explanation:** Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 2, K = 1
**Output:** [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= N <= 9`
2.  `0 <= K <= 9`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: DFS**
At each digit, we can only go `-K` or `+K`, therefore we can treat it as a tree question and apply DFS.
```python
class Solution:
    def numsSameConsecDiff(self, N: int, K: int) -> List[int]:
	    # Odd case
        if N == 1:
            return [i for i in range(10)]

        ans = []
        def DFS(N, num):
            # Base case, time to stop
            if N == 0:
                return ans.append(num)
			# Get the last digit of current number
            tail_digit = num % 10
            # Using set() to avoid duplicates when K == 0
            next_digits = set([tail_digit + K, tail_digit - K])
			# Traverse the tree
            for next_digit in next_digits:
	            # only if valid
                if 0 <= next_digit < 10: 
	                # Get current number
                    new_num = num * 10 + next_digit
                    DFS(N-1, new_num)

        for num in range(1, 10):
	        # N-1 to 0 for N length
            DFS(N-1, num)

        return list(ans)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**

O(N⋅2^N)
-    For each final combination, we would invoke the recursive function  N  times. The operations within each invocation takes a constant time  O(1).
    
-   Therefore, for a total  9⋅2^N−1^  number of potential combinations, a  **loose**  upper-bound on the time complexity of the algorithm would be  O(N⋅9⋅2^N−1^)=O(N⋅2^N^), since different combinations could share some efforts during the construction.
    
-   Note that, when  K=0, at each position, there is only one possible candidate,  _e.g._  333333. In total, we would have 9 numbers in the result set, and each number is of  N  digits. The time complexity would then be reduced down to  O(N).

**SC**

O(2^n)
-   Since we adopt a recursive solution, we would have some additional memory consumption on the function call stack. The maximum number of consecutive calls on the recursion function is  N. Hence, the space complexity for the call stack is  O(N).
    
-   We use a list to keep all the solutions, which could amount to  9⋅2^N−1^  number of elements.
    
-   To sum up, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is  O(N)+O(9⋅2^N−1^)=O(2^N^).

**Approach 2: BFS**
We initial the current result with all 1-digit numbers,  
like  `cur = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

Each turn, for each  `x`  in  `cur`,  
we get its last digit  `y = x % 10`.  
If  `y + K < 10`, we add  `x * 10 + y + K`  to the new list.  
If  `y - K >= 10`, we add  `x * 10 + y - K`  to the new list.

We repeat this step  `N - 1`  times and return the final result.
```python
class Solution:
    def numsSameConsecDiff(self, N: int, K: int) -> List[int]:
        cur = range(10)
        for i in range(N - 1):
            cur = {x * 10 + y for x in cur for y in [x % 10 + K, x % 10 - K] if x and 0 <= y < 10}
        return list(cur)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n^2^) if K<5, O(n) if K>=5, can't go up and up/down and down.

SC:O(2^n^) or O(n) similar to TC
