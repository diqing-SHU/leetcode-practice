## Question:
We are given an array  `asteroids`  of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** asteroids = [5,10,-5]
**Output:** [5,10]
**Explanation:** The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.  The 5 and 10 never collide.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** asteroids = [8,-8]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** asteroids = [10,2,-5]
**Output:** [10]
**Explanation:** The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** asteroids = [-2,-1,1,2]
**Output:** [-2,-1,1,2]
**Explanation:** The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right. Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= asteroids <= 104`
-   `-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000`
-   `asteroids[i] != 0`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: One pass**
Keep a list of survived asteroids and use the last asteroids to compare with next asteroid.
```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        p, res, prev = 1, [asteroids[0]], asteroids[0]
        while p < len(asteroids):
            if len(res)==0:
                res.append(asteroids[p])
                p+=1
                continue
            prev = res[-1]
            if prev > 0 and asteroids[p] < 0:
                if abs(prev) < abs(asteroids[p]):
                    res.pop()
                elif abs(prev) == abs(asteroids[p]):
                    res.pop()
                    p+=1
                else:
                    p+=1
            else:
                res.append(asteroids[p])
                p+=1
        return res
```

**Approach 2: Stack**
Let us traverse our asteroids from left to right and keep in stack so-called  `stable`  set: it means, that the will be no collisions anymore in our stack. What happen, when we add new asteroid: there can be  `3`  main cases:

1.  If we have in stack  `[....7]`  and we add  `-3`, then this last asteroid is destroyed, which is the last one: so if we have  `stack[-1] + stack[-2] > 0`, then we pop the last element fro our stack.
2.  If we have in stack  `[....3]`  and we add  `-7`, then asteroid with weight  `3`  is destroyed: so we need to pop one elements before last from our stack.
3.  If we have in stack  `[....3]`  and we add  `-3`, then both these two asteroids is destroyed: we remove two last elements from our stack.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDominoRotations(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
		stack = []
        for ast in asteroids:
            stack.append(ast)
            while len(stack) > 1 and stack[-1] < 0 and stack[-2] > 0:
                if stack[-1] + stack[-2] < 0: stack.pop(-2)
                elif stack[-1] + stack[-2] > 0: stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.pop()
                    stack.pop()
                    break
        
        return stack
```
