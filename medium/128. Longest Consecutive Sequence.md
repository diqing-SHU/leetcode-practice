# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Question

Given an unsorted array of integers  `nums`, return  _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
-   `-109  <= nums[i] <= 109`
## Solution

  

### Approach 1: Set

#### Intuition
By adopting set. We can reduce look up time to O(1).

However, simply count from minimum to maximum value will still take too long (value range: -10^9  <= nums[i] <= 10^9, while nums range: 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5)

We can try to count from each element in the array, stop if the next number is not in set. To avoid redundant calculations, we should not count shorter range that is covered.

#### Algorithm
1. build set with our nums
2. One pass all nums and try to count up if its a start of consecutive sequence (no previous one in set)
3. return the maximum of them

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 1
        # put nums in set
        res = 0
        numsSet = set(nums)
        for num in nums:
            currNum = num
            # if previous one is in set.
            # it will be longer if we start
            # counting from previous one
            if currNum-1 not in numsSet:
                # keep counting til we cant
                while currNum in numsSet:
                    currNum+=1
                # update res
                res = max(currNum - num, res)
        return res
```
Make it shorter
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		set_nums, ans = set(nums), 0
        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 in set_nums: continue
            nxt = num
            while nxt + 1 in set_nums:
                nxt += 1
            ans = max(ans, nxt-num+1)
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n), one pass the nums
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), to store our set
