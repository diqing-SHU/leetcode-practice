# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

## Question

A linked list of length  `n`  is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or  `null`.

Construct a  [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)  of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly  `n`  **brand new**  nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the  `next`  and  `random`  pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state.  **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes  `X`  and  `Y`  in the original list, where  `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes  `x`  and  `y`  in the copied list,  `x.random --> y`.

Return  _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of  `n`  nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of  `[val, random_index]`  where:

- `val`: an integer representing  `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from  `0`  to  `n-1`) that the  `random`  pointer points to, or  `null`  if it does not point to any node.

Your code will  **only**  be given the  `head`  of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
**Output:** [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)

**Input:** head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
**Output:** [[1,1],[2,1]]

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)**

**Input:** head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
**Output:** [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `-104  <= Node.val <= 104`
- `Node.random`  is  `null`  or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Hashmap

#### Intuition

We can use a hashmap to store created nodes and map to original node. Since there might be duplicates. We need to hash node objects.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass to create and store mapping
2. Assign randoms using the map
3. Return the new head

#### Code

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        def copyNode(node):
            if not node:
                return None
            if node not in createdMap:
                createdMap[node] = Node(node.val)
            nodeCopy = createdMap[node]
            nodeCopy.next = copyNode(node.next)
            if node.random:
                nodeCopy.random = createdMap[node.random]
            return nodeCopy
        createdMap = {}
        return copyNode(head)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , two pass all elements

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , extra hashmap used

### Approach 2: duplication

#### Intuition

Instead of extra hashmap. we can insert copied nodes right after their origin, which will also give us the mapping we need

#### Algorithm

1. One pass to insert copied nodes
2. Assign random to copied nodes (copy is the one after the random node)
4. Break and return copied head

#### Code

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head: return None
        # Create Mapping first
        pointer = head
        while pointer:
            newNode = Node(pointer.val)
            pointer.next, newNode.next, pointer = newNode, pointer.next, pointer.next
        # Do randoms now
        pointer = head
        while pointer:
            if pointer.random:
                pointer.next.random = pointer.random.next
            pointer = pointer.next.next
        # get our res
        res = pointer = head.next
        while pointer.next:
            pointer.next = pointer.next.next
            pointer = pointer.next
        return res
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , Two pass all nodes
- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , beside deepcopy of original nodes, constant extra space
