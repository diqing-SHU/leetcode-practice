# 384. Shuffle an Array

## Question

Given an integer array  `nums`, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. All permutations of the array should be  **equally likely**  as a result of the shuffling.

Implement the  `Solution`  class:

- `Solution(int[] nums)`  Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- `int[] reset()`  Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
- `int[] shuffle()`  Returns a random shuffling of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
["Solution", "shuffle", "reset", "shuffle"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], []]
**Output**
[null, [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]

**Explanation**
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.shuffle();    // Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result.
                       // Any permutation of [1,2,3] must be equally likely to be returned.
                       // Example: return [3, 1, 2]
solution.reset();      // Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3]. Return [1, 2, 3]
solution.shuffle();    // Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3]. Example: return [1, 3, 2]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `-106  <= nums[i] <= 106`
- All the elements of  `nums`  are  **unique**.
- At most  `5 * 104`  calls  **in total**  will be made to  `reset`  and  `shuffle`.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Built-in tools

#### Intuition

Take advantage of the built-in tool. I just don't want to leave it blank.

#### Algorithm

1. Use built-in random.shuffle()
2. deep copy since the operation is in-place

#### Code

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.originalNums = nums

    def reset(self) -> List[int]:
        """
        Resets the array to its original configuration and return it.
        """
        return self.originalNums

    def shuffle(self) -> List[int]:
        """
        Returns a random shuffling of the array.
        """
        random.seed()
        copyToShuffle = copy.deepcopy(self.originalNums)
        random.shuffle(copyToShuffle)
        return copyToShuffle
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, Pretty sure its using **Fisher-Yates Algorithm** under the hood
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, Deep copies (we only need one in fact)

---

### Approach 2: Fisher-Yates Algorithm

#### Intuition

The main idea behind this algorithm is for each element in the shuffled sequence, we can consider it as picking one element out of the pool of all elements. Each time we pick one, the pool also shrinks til there is one left.

One extra step this algorithm takes is: instead of puttin element into a pool, simply use the original array. we swap picked item to the index that we are picking for and move our pointer to select from the rest.

#### Algorithm

1. Search BST based on min, max of values
2. return node the first time we found one in range

#### Code

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.original = nums
        # try not to mutate input
        self.shuffled = copy.deepcopy(nums)

    def reset(self) -> List[int]:
        """
        Resets the array to its original configuration and return it.
        """
        return self.original

    def shuffle(self) -> List[int]:
        """
        Returns a random shuffling of the array.
        """
        random.seed()
        for i in range(len(self.shuffled)):
            randomIndex = random.randrange(i, len(self.shuffled))
            self.shuffled[i], self.shuffled[randomIndex] = self.shuffled[randomIndex], self.shuffled[i]
        return self.shuffled
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` number of swaps to perform
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, deep copy of original list
