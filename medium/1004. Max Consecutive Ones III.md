# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

## Question

Given a binary array  `nums`  and an integer  `k`, return  _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most_  `k`  `0`'s.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** [0,0,1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,1,**1**,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]`  is either  `0`  or  `1`.
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Sliding window

#### Intuition

To avoid duplicated calculation starting from every point. We should maintain a sliding window while traversing all elements.

Another thing to notice here is that our window size is determined by 0s we have in the window (up to k)

#### Algorithm

1. One pass the nums while maintaining `beg` and `end` of sliding window
2. Move end greedily if we still can (we still have zeros to change)
3. Otherwise, move `beg` and update zero status if needed
4. Once `end` reaches the end, no need to continue

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums, k):
        beg, end, zeroes, ans = 0, 0, 0, 0
        # Once end reaches the end
        # there is no need to shorten window
        while end < len(nums):
         # if we still can extend end
            if zeroes + (nums[end] == 0) <= k:
                zeroes += nums[end] == 0
                end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - beg)
            else:
             # otherwise we move beg
                zeroes -= nums[beg] == 0
                beg += 1  
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), `start` and `end` a both doing one pass
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant extra space
