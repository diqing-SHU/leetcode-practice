## Question:

An integer has  _sequential digits_  if and only if each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit.

Return a  **sorted**  list of all the integers in the range  `[low, high]` inclusive that have sequential digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** low = 100, high = 300
**Output:** [123,234]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** low = 1000, high = 13000
**Output:** [1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]

**Constraints:**

-   `10 <= low <= high <= 10^9`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Get All Combinations**
Simply calculate all possible combinations start from 1 all the way to 9. we record the ones that are >= low and stop when we reach one that are >= high.

```python
class Solution:
    def sequentialDigits(self, low: int, high: int) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        # Calculate all combinations starts from 1 - 9
        for digit in range(1, 9):
            num = next = digit
            # Stop until we reach 10 or go over high
            while num <= high and next < 10:
	            # Append if its higher than low
                if num >= low:
                    ans.append(num)
                next += 1
                num = num * 10 + next
        return sorted(ans)
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(1). There are only 45 combinations in total

**Approach 2: Queue**
Let us create queue, where we put numbers  `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9`  at the beginning. Then on each step we are going to extract number and put this number with added to the end incremented last digit: so we have on the next step:

`2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12`  
`3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,23`  
...  
`12,23,34,45,56,67,78,89`  
`23,34,45,56,67,78,89,123`,  
...

On each, when we extract number from the beginning we check if it is in our range and if it is, we put it into our  `out`  list. Then we add new candidate to the end of our queue. In this way we make sure, that we generate elements in increasing order.

```python
class Solution:
    def sequentialDigits(self, low: int, high: int) -> List[int]:
        out = []
        queue = deque(range(1,10))
        while queue:
            elem = queue.popleft()
            if low <= elem <= high:
                out.append(elem)
            last = elem % 10
            if last < 9: 
	            queue.append(elem*10 + last + 1)    
        return out
```
