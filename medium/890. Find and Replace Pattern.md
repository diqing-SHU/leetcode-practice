# 890. Find and Replace Pattern

  

## Question

Given a list of strings  `words`  and a string  `pattern`, return  _a list of_  `words[i]`  _that match_  `pattern`. You may return the answer in  **any order**.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters  `p`  so that after replacing every letter  `x`  in the pattern with  `p(x)`, we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
**Output:** ["mee","aqq"]
**Explanation:** "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
**Output:** ["a","b","c"]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= pattern.length <= 20`
-   `1 <= words.length <= 50`
-   `words[i].length == pattern.length`
-   `pattern`  and  `words[i]`  are lowercase English letters.

## Solution

  

### Approach 1: String manipulation

#### Intuition
We are doing searches for patterns. We are not matching partially. Which means a Hashmap/Dict is a good structure to use.

Another thing to solve is the pattern. We need a unique way to represent a word/pattern to avoid search for million words. One thing we can try is to translate word/pattern to variant that start with 'a', 'b' and so on.

#### Algorithm
- Create a helper to unify word/pattern.
- One pass the words and store processed word into a hashMap.
- Process the pattern and find corresponding words

```python
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        def unifyWord(word):
            mapping, searchString = {}, ''
            # int value of 'a'
            currChar = 97
            # convert word into unified searchString
            for char in word:
                if char not in mapping:
                    mapping[char] = chr(currChar)
                    currChar+=1
                searchString+=mapping[char]
            return searchString
            
        wordSearchDict = {}
        for word in words:
            unifiedword = unifyWord(word)
            if unifiedword not in wordSearchDict:
                wordSearchDict[unifiedword] = []
            wordSearchDict[unifiedword].append(word)
        searchString = unifyWord(pattern)
        if searchString not in wordSearchDict:
            return []
        return wordSearchDict[searchString]
```

#### Complexity Analysis

  

-  **Time Complexity:** O(n), if we consider all chars in words as we are one pass them
  

-  **Space Complexity:** O(n), our dict of unified words
