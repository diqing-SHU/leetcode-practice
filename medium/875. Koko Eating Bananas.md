# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

## Question

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are  `n`  piles of bananas, the  `ith`  pile has  `piles[i]`  bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in  `h`  hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of  `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats  `k`  bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than  `k`  bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return  _the minimum integer_  `k`  _such that she can eat all the bananas within_  `h`  _hours_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
**Output:** 30

**Example 3:**

**Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
**Output:** 23

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= piles.length <= 104`
- `piles.length <= h <= 109`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`

## Solution

### Approach 1: Binary Search

#### Intuition

We know the min and max of the speed we could have. To get the minium speed, we can do a binary search for it.

#### Algorithm

1. Do binary search between 1 and max of piles
2. For each speed, we'll need to calculate the time

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        def getTime(speed):
            res = 0
            for pile in piles:
                res += math.ceil(pile/speed)
            return res
        piles.sort()
        lo, hi = 1, max(piles)
        while lo<hi:
            mid = (lo+hi)//2
            if getTime(mid) <= h:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return lo
            
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(nlogn)` , sort takes O(nlogn). Calculating

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` Constant space
