## Question:
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return  `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer  `pos`  which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If  `pos`  is  `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:**  Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** no cycle
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Hash Map**
Use hash map to store the node we've visited. Check for each node until we find cycle or reach the end.
```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        nodeHash = {}
        while head:
            if head in nodeHash:
                return head
            else:
                nodeHash[head] = 1
            head = head.next
        return head
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**

O(n) Need to travel all the nodes until we find cycle

**SC**

O(n) Need to store visited nodes

**Approach 2: 2 Pointers**
One step further than the good old 2 pointers. When the 2 pointers meets we know there are cycle.
Then, we move the slow pointer back to head and let slow and fast travel 1 step at a time. When they meet again, we are at the node we want.
```
Consider the following linked list, where E is the cylce entry and X, the crossing point of fast and slow.
 H: distance from head to cycle entry E
 D: distance from E to X
 L: cycle length
                   _____
                  /     \
 head_____H______E       \
                 \       /
                  X_____/   
 

 If fast and slow both start at head, when fast catches slow, slow has traveled H+D and fast 2(H+D). 
 Assume fast has traveled n loops in the cycle, we have:
 2H + 2D = H + D + L  -->  H + D = nL  --> H = nL - D
 Thus if two pointers start from head and X, respectively, one first reaches E, the other also reaches E. 
```


```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
	    slow = fast = head
	    while fast and fast.next:
	        slow = slow.next
	        fast = fast.next.next
	        if slow == fast:
	            break
	    else:
	        return None
	    while head != slow:
	        slow = slow.next
	        head = head.next
	    return head
```
  

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) About 2 passes
  

SC:O(1) No extra space
