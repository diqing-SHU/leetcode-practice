## Question:

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
**Output:** [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
**Explanation:** 
The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:

After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,null,3]
**Output:** [1,3,2]
**Explanation:** The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

**How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:**

We use the multilevel linked list from  **Example 1**  above:

 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

The serialization of each level is as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]

To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

**Constraints:**

-   Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Iterative**
DFS approach here. use order list to make things more clear:
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head: return head
        stack, order = [head], []

        while stack:
            last = stack.pop()
            order.append(last)
            if last.next:
                stack.append(last.next)
            if last.child:
                stack.append(last.child)
        
        for i in range(len(order) - 1):
            order[i+1].prev = order[i]
            order[i].next = order[i+1]
            order[i].child = None
            
        return order[0]
```
Or, we can directly work on nodes:
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head: return head
        # Dummy head
        dummy = Node(0)
        curr, stack = dummy, [head]
        while stack:
            last = stack.pop() 
            if last.next:
                stack.append(last.next)
            if last.child:
                stack.append(last.child)
            curr.next = last
            last.prev = curr
            last.child = None
            curr = last
        
        res = dummy.next
        res.prev = None
        return res
```

**Approach 2: Recursive**
Seems like I have `Time Limit Exceeded` error. Each recursion creates 2 recursion calls. This is bad
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head: return None
        def travel(node):
            while node:
                # Holds next
                nextHolder = node.next
                # If we dont have next
                # Set as tail so we will return it
                if not nextHolder: 
                    tail = node
                if node.child:
	                # Set next as child
                    node.next = node.child
                    node.child.prev = node
                    # Get child tail
                    childTail = travel(node.child)
                    # If we have next, insert childTail
                    if nextHolder:
                        nextHolder.prev = childTail
                    childTail.next= nextHolder
	                # Clear child since its moved
                    node.child = None
                # We good, let go to next
                node = node.next
            return tail
        travel(head)
        return head
```
Make it pettier:
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        def dfs(node):
            if node.child:
	            # Get child tail
                tail = dfs(node.child)
                # If we have next, add child in
                if node.next:
	                node.next.prev, tail.next = tail, node.next
	            # Update other fields that won't be affected by whether we have next
                node.child.prev, node.next, node.child = node, node.child, None
            # Need to return the tail, so we can attach
            if not node.next: return node
            return dfs(node.next)
        
        if not head: return
        dfs(head)
        return head
```
