Here we provide a comparison of  `time complexity`  between the linked list and other data structures including  [array](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/), queue and stack:

After this comparison, it is not difficult to come up with our conclusion:

> If you need to add or delete a node frequently, a linked list could be a good choice.
> 
> If you need to access an element by index often, an array might be a better choice than a linked list.
