## Question:



Given a linked list, remove the  _n_-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

Given linked list: **1->2->3->4->5**, and **_n_ = 2**.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes **1->2->3->5**.

**Note:**

Given  _n_  will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?
## Solution:
**Approach 1: 2 Pass**
One pass to count the length. Second pass to find and remove the element:
1. If its the first element, return the second as head
2. If its not the first element, find its previous node and points to its next.next
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        count = 0
        pointer = head
        while pointer:
            pointer = pointer.next
            count+=1
        if count == n:
            head = head.next
        else:
            count = count-n
            pointer = head
            # compare to 1 since we are modifying previous node
            while count > 1:
                pointer = pointer.next
                count-=1
            if pointer.next:
                pointer.next = pointer.next.next
        return head
            
```

**TC**

O(n) Two pass

**SC**

O(1) Constant space used

**Approach 2: 2 Pointers**
Since we want to remove nth node from the tail. if we use two pointer that have n node difference and travel together one step at a time. When the fast reaches the end, the slow will be at the nth node from tail.
But in order to remove nth, we need to stop at (n+1)th. 
Therefore, we can let fast travel n+1 node. Then put slow at head and travel with fast to find the (n+1)th.
If we hit None while traveling n+1, we are facing removing head situation. so we just return head.next


```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        p1, p2 = head, head
        # Create the distance first
        for i in range(n+1):
            if p1:
                p1 = p1.next
            # Couldn't create the distance to get n+1 element
            # Which means we are removing the head
            else:
                return head.next
        while p1:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
        if p2.next:
            p2.next = p2.next.next
        return head
```
