# 828. Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String

## Question

Let's define a function  `countUniqueChars(s)`  that returns the number of unique characters on  `s`.

- For example, calling  `countUniqueChars(s)`  if  `s = "LEETCODE"`  then  `"L"`,  `"T"`,  `"C"`,  `"O"`,  `"D"`  are the unique characters since they appear only once in  `s`, therefore  `countUniqueChars(s) = 5`.

Given a string  `s`, return the sum of  `countUniqueChars(t)`  where  `t`  is a substring of  `s`.

Notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ABC"
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Every substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "ABA"
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The same as example 1, except `countUniqueChars`("ABA") = 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "LEETCODE"
**Output:** 92

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s`  consists of uppercase English letters only.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Amazon version

#### Intuition

Amazon version ask to count duplicated char in substring as 1.
We can keep count of all seen char counts to avoid checking all substrings since we dont care about ordering

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all chars
2. Keep accumulating our appeared count
3. For duplicated ones, we only count their latest contribution
4. Return the total

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueLetterString(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, appeared, count = 0, {}, 1
        for char in s:
            if char not in appeared:
                appeared[char] = count
            else:
                # newer same char will have more counts
                # sample:
                #   E
                # E E
                # E E
                prevSeen = appeared[char]
                # we will need to remove previous count to add new count
                res -= prevSeen
                # we update if we want to count multiple
                # same chars in one substring as one
                # remove 2 keep 3
                appeared[char] = count
            # count unique char in all substrings
            for char in appeared:
                res += appeared[char]
            count += 1
        return res
        
            
                    
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , One pass the string while updating the 26 char count hashmap

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(1)` , Our count of 26 characters

### Approach 2: Prev sum

#### Intuition

Similar to previous solution, we need to filter out all duplicated chars between new and old sums.
To do this and keep updating count, we keep one extra prev sum to help add unique count in.

#### Algorithm

1. One pass all chars
2. Keep accumulating our appeared count
3. For duplicated ones, we store previous sum so that we can use the difference(unique ones)
4. Return the total

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueLetterString(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, appeared, count = 0, {}, 1
        for char in s:
            if char not in appeared:
                appeared[char] = [0, count]
            else:
                # newer same char will have more counts
                # sample:
                #   E
                # E E
                # E E
                # keep 2 prev so we can calculate unique chars
                # while keep previous for first appeared chars
                prevSeen2, prevSeen1 = appeared[char]
                appeared[char] = [prevSeen1, count]
            # count unique char in all substrings
            for char in appeared:
                # if we want to avoid counting
                # duplicated chars in one substring
                # we should add the diff
                # keep 1(3-2)
                prevSeen2, prevSeen1 = appeared[char]
                res += prevSeen1-prevSeen2
            count += 1
        return res
        
```
