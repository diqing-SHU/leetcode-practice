# 2104. Sum of Subarray Ranges

## Question

You are given an integer array  `nums`. The  **range**  of a subarray of  `nums`  is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the subarray.

Return  _the  **sum of all**  subarray ranges of_ `nums`_._

A subarray is a contiguous  **non-empty**  sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0
[2], range = 2 - 2 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,2], range = 2 - 1 = 1
[2,3], range = 3 - 2 = 1
[1,2,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,3,3]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
[3,3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,3,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,-2,-3,4,1]
**Output:** 59
**Explanation:** The sum of all subarray ranges of nums is 59.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-109  <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Follow-up:**  Could you find a solution with  `O(n)`  time complexity?

## Solution

### Approach 1: Monotonic stack

#### Intuition

Similar to the contribution idea. To get the sum of ranges:(`sum(max-min)`) => `sum(max)-sum(min)`. Which means we can calculate the sum for `max` and `min` for all substrings separately.
To do that, we can just keep a monotonic stack of prev min/max while one pass the array. A trick that we can use in this case is to attach absolute min/max to head and tail of nums to help calculate the distance. And we can make the calculation before each time we pop up index. Since we should count before before the information goes away. (append at the end, so last dummy min/max wont be counted)

#### Algorithm

1. Break the question down to get sum for min and max
2. Use monotonic stack to help record prev min/max index
3. One pass array to count contribution for each prev min/max

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def subArrayRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        inf = float('inf')
        # fill start and end with min value
        # to help calculating distance
        mins = [-inf] + nums + [-inf]
        # stack to hold indexes of prev mins
        s = []
        for i, x in enumerate(mins):
            # start popping and calculating
            # when we have prev mins and
            # need to remove/update greater ones
            while s and mins[s[-1]] > x:
                # prev min index that needs to be counted
                j = s.pop()
                # index for prev min before j
                k = s[-1]
                # calculate the mins for all the substrings having it
                # - since res = sum(max-min) => sum(max)-sum(min)
                res -= mins[j] * (i - j) * (j - k)
            s.append(i)
            
        # fill start and end with max value
        # to help calculating distance
        maxs = [inf] + nums + [inf]
        # stack to hold indexes of prev maxs
        s = []
        for i, x in enumerate(maxs):
            # start popping and calculating
            # when we have prev max and
            # need to remove/update smaller ones
            while s and maxs[s[-1]] < x:
                # prev max index that needs to be counted
                j = s.pop()
                # index for prev max before j
                k = s[-1]
                # calculate the mins for all the substrings having it
                # + since res = sum(max-min) => sum(max)-sum(min)
                res += maxs[j] * (i - j) * (j - k)
            s.append(i)
        return res
        
            
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  `O(n)` , Over all iterations, we will do max of `n` pops. Thus, I think its still `O(n)` time

- **Space Complexity:**  `O(n)` , Our monotonic stack
