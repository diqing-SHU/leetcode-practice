## Question:


In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance. The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array  `days`. Each day is an integer from  `1`  to  `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

-   a 1-day pass is sold for  `costs[0]`  dollars;
-   a 7-day pass is sold for  `costs[1]`  dollars;
-   a 30-day pass is sold for  `costs[2]`  dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel. For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of  `days`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
**Output:** 17
**Explanation:** 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= days.length <= 365`
2.  `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
3.  `days`  is in strictly increasing order.
4.  `costs.length == 3`
5.  `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`
## Solution:


**Approach 1: DP with all days array**
Store the minimum cost for every day we have to travel. Compare `dp[i-1] + costs[0]`, `dp[max(i-7, 0)] + costs[1]`, and `dp[max(i-30, 0)] + costs[2]`. 
```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        last_day = days[-1]
        days = set(days)
        dp = [0 for _ in range(last_day+1)]
        
        for i in range(1, last_day+1):
            if i not in days:
                # Don't need to travel
                dp[i] = dp[i-1]
                continue
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + costs[0], 
                       min(
                           dp[max(i-7, 0)] + costs[1],
                           dp[max(i-30, 0)] + costs[2]
                          )
                       )
        return dp[-1]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(w) Something less than 365,  its days array

**SC** 
O(w) Days array, can be optimized to 30 as the longest day we will reference back is 30 days ago

---

**Approach 2: DP with queue for last 7 and last 30**
Keep track of `last1`, `last7` and `last30`.  Then go over the travel days. We keep the minimum amount of spending from `last1`, `last7` and `last30` of today.
```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
	    # no need to hold more than one data for last1
        last1, last7, last30 = 0, [], []
        for day in days:
            while last7 and last7[0][0]<=day-7:
                last7.pop(0)
            while last30 and last30[0][0]<=day-30:
                last30.pop(0)
            # if we buy 1, 7, 30 today
            last7.append([day, last1+costs[1]])
            last30.append([day, last1+costs[2]])
            last1 = min(last1+costs[0], last7[0][1], last30[0][1])
        return last1
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(n) Just all the travel days

**SC** 
O(1) constant space needed (1+7+30=38 to be exact)
