## Question:


Say you have an array for which the  _i_th  element is the price of a given stock on day  _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most  _two_  transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: DP**
This is actually hard. Code is in Java
> It's not difficult to get the DP recursive formula:

```
dp[k, i] = max(dp[k, i-1], prices[i] - prices[j] + dp[k-1, j-1]), j=[0..i-1]
```
For k transactions, on i-th day,  
if we don't trade then the profit is same as previous day dp[k, i-1];  
and if we bought the share on j-th day where j=[0..i-1], then sell the share on i-th day then the profit is prices[i] - prices[j] + dp[k-1, j-1] .  
Actually j can be i as well. When j is i, the one more extra item prices[i] - prices[j] + dp[k-1, j] = dp[k-1, i] looks like we just lose one chance of transaction.

I see someone else use the formula dp[k, i] = max(dp[k, i-1], prices[i] - prices[j] + dp[k-1, j]), where the last one is dp[k-1, j] instead of dp[k-1, j-1]. It's not the direct sense, as if the share was bought on j-th day, then the total profit of previous transactions should be done on (j-1)th day. However, the result based on that formula is also correct, because if the share was sold on j-th day and then bought again, it is the same if we didn't trade on that day.

So the straightforward implementation is:

```java
        public int MaxProfitDp(int[] prices) {
            if (prices.Length == 0) return 0;
            var dp = new int[3, prices.Length];
            for (int k = 1; k <= 2; k++)  {
                for (int i = 1; i < prices.Length; i++) {
                    int min = prices[0];
                    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
                        min = Math.Min(min, prices[j] - dp[k-1, j-1]);
                    dp[k, i] = Math.Max(dp[k, i-1], prices[i] - min);
                }
            }

            return dp[2, prices.Length - 1];
        }
```

Time complexity is O(kn^2), space complexity is O(kn).  
In the above code, min is repeated calculated. It can be easily improved as:

```java
        public int MaxProfitDpCompact1(int[] prices) {
            if (prices.Length == 0) return 0;
            var dp = new int[3, prices.Length];
            for (int k = 1; k <= 2; k++) {
                int min = prices[0];
                for (int i = 1; i < prices.Length; i++) {
                    min = Math.Min(min, prices[i] - dp[k-1, i-1]);
                    dp[k, i] = Math.Max(dp[k, i-1], prices[i] - min);
                }
            }

            return dp[2, prices.Length - 1];
        }

```

Time complexity is O(kn), space complexity is O(kn).  
If we slight swap the two 'for' loops:

```java
        public int MaxProfitDpCompact1T(int[] prices) {
            if (prices.Length == 0) return 0;
            var dp = new int[3, prices.Length];
            var min = new int[3];
            Array.Fill(min, prices[0]);
            for (int i = 1; i < prices.Length; i++) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= 2; k++) {
                    min[k] = Math.Min(min[k], prices[i] - dp[k-1, i-1]);
                    dp[k, i] = Math.Max(dp[k, i-1], prices[i] - min[k]);
                }
            }

            return dp[2, prices.Length - 1];
        }

```

We need to save min for each transaction, so there are k 'min'.  
We can find the second dimension (variable i) is only dependent on the previous one (i-1), so we can compact this dimension. (We can choose the first dimension (variable k) as well since it is also only dependent on its previous one k-1, but can't compact both.)

```java
        public int MaxProfitDpCompact2(int[] prices) {
            if (prices.Length == 0) return 0;
            var dp = new int[3];
            var min = new int[3];
            Array.Fill(min, prices[0]);
            for (int i = 1; i < prices.Length; i++)  {
                for (int k = 1; k <= 2; k++) {
                    min[k] = Math.Min(min[k], prices[i] - dp[k-1]);
                    dp[k] = Math.Max(dp[k], prices[i] - min[k]);
                }
            }

            return dp[2];
        }

```

So time complexity is O(kn), space complexity becomes O(k).  
In this case, K is 2. We can expand the array to all named variables:

```java
        public int MaxProfitDpCompactFinal(int[] prices)  {
            int buy1 = int.MaxValue, buy2 = int.MaxValue;
            int sell1 = 0, sell2 = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < prices.Length; i++) {
                buy1 = Math.Min(buy1, prices[i]);
                sell1 = Math.Max(sell1, prices[i] - buy1);
                buy2 = Math.Min(buy2, prices[i] - sell1);
                sell2 = Math.Max(sell2, prices[i] - buy2);
            }

            return sell2;
        }
```

We can also explain the above codes in other words. On every day, we buy the share with the price as low as we can, and sell the share with price as high as we can. For the second transaction, we integrate the profit of first transaction into the cost of the second buy, then the profit of the second sell will be the total profit of two transactions.

Is this greedy? I think it is.
Some nice comment to help understand:

This is DP with optimization on space!

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        oneBuy, twoBuy, oneBuyOneSell, twoBuyTwoSell = float('-inf'), float('-inf'), 0, 0
        for price in prices:
            # maxium profit for twoBuy till today
            twoBuyTwoSell = max(twoBuyTwoSell, twoBuy+price)
            # minium money to do twoBuy till today (we have to sell oneBuy first, using maxium profit til yesterday)
            twoBuy    = max(twoBuy, oneBuyOneSell-price)
            # maxium profit for oneBuy till today
            oneBuyOneSell = max(oneBuyOneSell, oneBuy+price)
            # minium money to do oneBuy till today
            oneBuy   = max(oneBuy, -price)
            print(twoBuy,oneBuy,oneBuyOneSell,oneBuy)
        # twoBuyTwoSell hold same value as oneBuyOneSell if we only did oneBuyOneSell
        # but we write this way to show hte logic
        return max(oneBuyOneSell, twoBuyTwoSell);
