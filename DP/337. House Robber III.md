## Question:
The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1 
**Output:** 7 
**Explanation:** Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = **7**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = **9**.
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Bottom-up DFS**
We go from bottom to top while maintaining max profit whether rob current node or not. Since the DP relation here is: 
1. `now = node.val + left[1] + right[1]`
2. `later = max(left) + max(right)`
And for each node, we just need left and right max to proceed. Thus, we can use DFS recursion to solve.
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def superrob(node):
            # returns tuple of size two (now, later)
            # now: max money earned if input node is robbed
            # later: max money earned if input node is not robbed
            
            # base case
            if not node: return (0, 0)
            
            # get values
            left, right = superrob(node.left), superrob(node.right)
            
            # rob this node
            now = node.val + left[1] + right[1]
            
            # dont rob this node
            # we choose whether to rob left or right child based on profit
            later = max(left) + max(right)
            
            return (now, later)
            
        return max(superrob(root))
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(nâ€‹) All node visited

**SC** 
O(n) each node has a `tuple`
