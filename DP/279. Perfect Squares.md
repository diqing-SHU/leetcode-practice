## Question:

Given a positive integer  _n_, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example,  `1, 4, 9, 16, ...`) which sum to  _n_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** _n_ = `12`
**Output:** 3 
**Explanation:** `12 = 4 + 4 + 4.`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** _n_ = `13`
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** `13 = 4 + 9.`
## Solution:
**Approach 1: BFS**
This can be treated as a shortest path question. BFS fits right in. We can generate a dict/set of possible perfect square numbers and use it to determine the successors.
Good thing to notice `list.pop(0)` is O(n) operation. So we need to rely on `deque` with `popleft()` to avoid TLE
```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        toDoList, nextLevel, visited, PSN, res = deque([n]), [], set(), {}, 0
        # n+1 is not include, dont just put n here
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i*i <= n:
                PSN[i] = i*i
            else:
                break
        while len(toDoList)>0:
            curr = toDoList.popleft()
            # Check if we already have a shorter path
            if curr not in visited:
                # If not do the checking
                if curr == 0:
                    return res
                visited.add(curr)
                nextLevel+=self.getSuccessor(curr, PSN)
            # Handle next level
            if len(toDoList)==0:
                toDoList.extend(nextLevel)
                nextLevel = []
                res += 1
        # We should always have an ans for this question
        # But put in here to show the logic
        return -1
    
    def getSuccessor(self, num, PSN):
        res = []
        for key in PSN:
            if PSN[key] <= num:
                res.append(num-PSN[key])
            else:
	            # We know its increasing
                break
        return res
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**
O(n^2^) 
-   The depth of the BFS is at most 4 by the four-square theorem (every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares)
-   At every dept there will be at most sqrt(n) children, because there's at most sqrt(n) perfect squares that are smaller than n

Therefore, (sqrt(n))^4^ = nÂ²

**SC**

O(n^2^) 
BFS has the same space and time complexity upper bound

**Approach 2: DP**
We can think of this problem as a DP. For example, `dp[12]` can be the minium of (`dp[11]`, `dp[8]`, `dp[3]`) + 1
```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        # 0 to n, so n+1 in total
        dp = [float('+inf')]*(n+1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            # Initalize with max value
            minValue = float('+inf')
            j = 1
            # Get the minimum step from all possible perfect square numbers
            while i >= j*j:
                minValue = min(minValue, dp[i - j*j] + 1)
                j+=1
            dp[i] = minValue
        return dp[n]
```
We can improve a lot by avoiding unnecessary DP calculations between test cases with global variable. kinda of cheating, tho
```python
class Solution:
    _dp = [0]
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = self._dp
        while len(dp) < n+1:
            minValue = float('+inf')
            j = 1
            # Get the minimum step from all possible perfect square numbers
            while len(dp) >= j*j:
                minValue = min(minValue, dp[len(dp) - j*j] + 1)
                j+=1
            dp.append(minValue)
        return dp[n]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n sqrt(n)) For each num in n, need to check j for all 0 - num.

**Approach 3: Math**
First of all, there is a statement that any number can be represented as sum of 4 squares:  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange's_four-square_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem). So, answer always will be 4? No, when we talk about  `4`  squares, it means that some of them can be equal to zero. So, we have  `4`  options: either  `1`,  `2`,  `3`  or  `4`  squares and we need to choose one of these numbers.

1.  How to check if number is full square? Just compare square of integer part of root and this number. Complexity of this part is  `O(1)`.
2.  How to check if number is sum of  `2`  squares:  `n = i*i + j*j`? iterate ovell all  `i < sqrt(n)`  and check that  `n - i*i`  is full square. Complexity of this part is  `O(sqrt(n))`.
3.  How to check that number is sum of  `4`  squares? In the same link for wikipedia:  
    `by proving that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form 4^k(8m+7) for integers k and m`. So, what we need to do is to check this condition and return true if it fulfilled. Complexity is  `O(log n)`
4.  Do we need to check anything else? No, because we have only one options left:  `3`  squares.

**Complexity**: time complexity is  `O(sqrt(n))`  and space complexity is  `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:  
	def numSquares(self, n:  int)  ->  int:
        if int(sqrt(n))**2 == n: return 1
        for j in range(int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if int(sqrt(n - j*j))**2 == n - j*j: return 2
            
        while n % 4 == 0: 
            n >>= 2
        if n % 8 == 7: return 4
        return 3
```
With global variable:
```python
class Solution:
    _dp = [0]
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = self._dp
        while len(dp) <= n:
            dp += min(dp[-i*i] for i in range(1, int(len(dp)**0.5+1))) + 1
        return dp[n]
```
**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(sqrt(n)) Math is hard but so efficient
