## Question:

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys  **less than**  the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys  **greater than**  the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

    2
   / \
  1   3

**Input:** [2,1,3]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

**Input:** [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Recursion**
The idea above could be implemented as a recursion. One compares the node value with its upper and lower limits if they are available. Then one repeats the same step recursively for left and right subtrees.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def helper(node, lower = float('-inf'), upper = float('inf')):
            if not node:
                return True
            
            val = node.val
            if val <= lower or val >= upper:
                return False

            if not helper(node.right, val, upper):
                return False
            if not helper(node.left, lower, val):
                return False
            return True

        return helper(root)
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). we visit each node exactly once

**SC** 
O(n) we keep up to the entire tree

---

**Approach 2: Iteration**
The above recursion could be converted into iteration, with the help of stack. DFS would be better than BFS since it works faster here.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
            
        stack = [(root, float('-inf'), float('inf')), ] 
        while stack:
            root, lower, upper = stack.pop()
            if not root:
                continue
            val = root.val
            if val <= lower or val >= upper:
                return False
            stack.append((root.right, val, upper))
            stack.append((root.left, lower, val))
        return True
```



**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). we visit each node exactly once

**SC** 
O(n) we keep up to the entire tree

**Approach 3: Inorder traversal**
`Left -> Node -> Right`  order of in-order traversal means for BST that each element should be smaller than the next one.

Hence the algorithm with  O(N)  time complexity and  O(N)  space complexity could be simple:

-   Compute in-order traversal list  `inorder`.
    
-   Check if each element in  `inorder`  is smaller than the next one.

The last added in-order element is enough to ensure at each step that the tree is BST (or not). Hence one could merge both steps into one and reduce the used space.
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        stack, inorder = [], float('-inf')
        
        while stack or root:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            root = stack.pop()
            # If next element in inorder traversal
            # is smaller than the previous one
            # that's not BST.
            if root.val <= inorder:
                return False
            inorder = root.val
            root = root.right

        return True
```
