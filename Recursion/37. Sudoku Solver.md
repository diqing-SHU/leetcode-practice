## Question:
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy  **all of the following rules**:

1.  Each of the digits `1-9`  must occur exactly once in each row.
2.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3.  Each of the digits `1-9`  must occur exactly once in each of the 9  `3x3`  sub-boxes of the grid.

The  `'.'`  character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
**Output:** [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
**Explanation:** The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

**Constraints:**

-   `board.length == 9`
-   `board[i].length == 9`
-   `board[i][j]`  is a digit or  `'.'`.
-   It is  **guaranteed**  that the input board has only one solution.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Backtrack**
We can utilize backtrack technique to try filling in all empty slots in order with values from `1 - 9`. Here I use a `toDoList` list to hold all empty positions and a `currIndex`to keep track of our progress. Once `currIndex` points out of `toDoList`, we know that we found one solution (the answer here, since we are guaranteed to have single solution). `checkValid`, `placeNum` and `removeNum` are pretty self-explanatory. But in order for us to stop when we find the correct answer, we need the `backtrack` function to return `True`
```python
class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        def placeNum(row, col, num):
            board[row][col] = num
            
        def checkValid(row, col, num):
            for n in range(9):
                if board[row][n] == num:
                    return False
                if board[n][col] == num:
                    return False
            # Starting point for the 3*3 box where this position belongs
            boxLeft = row//3*3
            boxDown = col//3*3
            for n in range(3):
                for l in range(3):
                    if (boxLeft+n!=row and boxDown+l!=col):
                        if board[boxLeft+n][boxDown+l] == num:
                            return False
            return True
        
        def removeNum(row, col):
            board[row][col] = '.'
            
        def backtrack(toDoList, currIndex):
            if currIndex < len(toDoList):
                (row, col) = toDoList[currIndex];
                for num in range(1, 10):
                    if checkValid(row, col, str(num)):
                        placeNum(row, col, str(num));
                        # if we found solution, we need to stop backtracking and return True to outer calls to stop
                        if backtrack(toDoList, currIndex+1):
                            return True
                        removeNum(row, col);
            else:
                # We found solution, need to return True to stop early
                return True
            
        toDoList = []            
        for row in range(len(board)):
            for col in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[row][col] == '.':
                    toDoList.append((row,col))
        backtrack(toDoList, 0)
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(9^m) `checkValid`, `placeNum` and `removeNum` are all O(1) operations (since the size is constant -> `9*9`). The maximum trials we can have are 9 for each slot. If there are `m` slots empty, time complexity will be O(9^m) 


**SC** 
O(m) Used `toDoList` to keep track of empty slots
