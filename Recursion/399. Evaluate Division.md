## Question:

You are given  `equations` in the format  `A / B = k`, where  `A`  and  `B`  are variables represented as strings, and  `k`  is a real number (floating-point number). Given some  `queries`, return  _the answers_. If the answer does not exist, return  `-1.0`.

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
**Output:** [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
**Explanation:** 
Given: _a / b = 2.0_, _b / c = 3.0_
queries are: _a / c = ?_, _b / a = ?_, _a / e = ?_, _a / a = ?_, _x / x = ?_
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
**Output:** [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
**Output:** [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= equations.length <= 20`
-   `equations[i].length == 2`
-   `1 <= equations[i][0], equations[i][1] <= 5`
-   `values.length == equations.length`
-   `0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0`
-   `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
-   `queries[i].length == 2`
-   `1 <= queries[i][0], queries[i][1] <= 5`
-   `equations[i][0], equations[i][1], queries[i][0], queries[i][1]` consist of lower case English letters and digits.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Graph BFS**
Although this looks like a math problem, we can easily model it with graph.

For example:  
Given:  
a/b = 2.0, b/c = 3.0  
We can build a directed graph:  
a -- 2.0 --> b -- 3.0 --> c  
If we were asked to find a/c, we have:  
a/c = a/b * b/c = 2.0 * 3.0  
In the graph, it is the product of costs of edges.

Do notice that, 2 edges need to added into the graph with one given equation,  
because with a/b we also get result of b/a, which is the reciprocal of a/b.

so the previous example also gives edges:  
c -- 0.333 --> b -- 0.5 --> a

Now we know how to model this problem, what we need to do is simply build the  
graph with given equations, and traverse the graph, either DFS or BFS, to find a path  
for a given query, and the result is the product of costs of edges on the path.

One optimization, which is not implemented in the code, is to "compress" paths for  
past queries, which will make future searches faster. This is the same idea used in  
compressing paths in union find set. So after a query is conducted and a result is found,  
we add two edges for this query if these edges are not already in the graph.

Given the number of variables N, and number of equations E,  
building the graph takes O(E), each query takes O(N), space for graph takes O(E)

I think if we start to compress paths, the graph will grow to O(N^2), and we  
can optimize the query to O(1), please correct me if I'm wrong.

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:

        graph = {}
        
        def build_graph(equations, values):
            def add_edge(f, t, value):
                if f in graph:
                    graph[f].append((t, value))
                else:
                    graph[f] = [(t, value)]
            
            for vertices, value in zip(equations, values):
                f, t = vertices
                add_edge(f, t, value)
                add_edge(t, f, 1/value)
        
        def find_path(query):
            b, e = query
            
            if b not in graph or e not in graph:
                return -1.0
                
            q = collections.deque([(b, 1.0)])
            visited = set()
            
            while q:
                front, cur_product = q.popleft()
                if front == e:
                    return cur_product
                visited.add(front)
                for neighbor, value in graph[front]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        q.append((neighbor, cur_product*value))
            
            return -1.0
        
        build_graph(equations, values)
        return [find_path(q) for q in queries]
```
We can optimize it by added "shortcut" paths to our graph, or complete the graph in another word, while we are dealing with each query. So that next time, we can find this "shortcut" path at 1st level of BFS. In the end, if we completed the graph, all queries will just take O(1) time.
```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        graph = defaultdict(dict)
        for ([x,y],value) in zip(equations, values):
            graph[x][y] = value
            graph[y][x] = 1/value
        
        def find_prod(s,e):
            if s not in graph or e not in graph:
                return -1.0
            if s==e: return 1.0
            q = deque([(s, 1.0)])
            visited = {s}
            while q:
                n, curr = q.popleft()
                for child,value in graph[n].items():
                    if child in visited:
                        continue
                    nc = curr*value
                    if child == e:
                        return nc
                    graph[s][child] = nc
                    graph[child][s] = 1/nc
                    visited.add(child)
                    q.append((child, nc))
            return -1.0
        
        return [find_prod(s,e) for [s,e] in queries]
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
If there are `m` queries, `q` equations and `n` distinct values. 
O(m * n^2) Without optimization, it will be `O(m(q+n))` ~ `O(m * n^2)` as `q` can grow to the order of `n^2`
O(n^2/m) After optimization, it will be`O(q+n)` ~ `O(n^2)` for all the `m` queries as we traverse each path at most once during all the queries, so I the the amortized time complexity will be `O(n^2/m)`

**SC** 
O(n^2^) if we use 2-D array
O(n) if we use 1-D array

**Approach 2: Math**
In this problem, whenever a location `(x, y`) is occupied, any other locations `(p, q )` where `p + q == x + y` or `p - q == x - y` would be invalid.

We can use this information to keep track of the indicators (`xy_dif` and `xy_sum` ) of the invalid positions and then call DFS recursively with valid positions only.

Here is the proof:
```
0 1 2 3  
1 2 3 4  
2 3 4 5  
3 4 5 6  
^This is xy_sum(i + j)

0 -1 -2 -3  
1 0 -1 -2  
2 1 0 -1  
3 2 1 0  
^This is xy_dif(i-j)
```


```python
class Solution:
    def totalNQueens(self, n: int) -> int:
        def backTrack(xList, xyDiffList, xySumList, count):
            # For row we are just going from 0 to n-1
            currRow = len(xSet)
            # We are at the end
            if currRow == n:
                return count+1
            for col in range(n):
                if col not in xList and currRow-col not in xyDiffList and currRow+col not in xySumList:
	                # We doing this to achieve deep copy
                    count = backTrack(xList+[col], xyDiffList+[currRow-col], xySumList+[currRow+col], count)
            return count
        return backTrack([],[],[], 0)
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n!). Each row we will have less col to deal with

**SC** 
O(n) 3 sets to keep

**Approach 3: Closure Number**
To enumerate something, generally we would like to express it as a sum of disjoint subsets that are easier to count.

Consider the  _closure number_  of a valid parentheses sequence  `S`: the least  `index >= 0`  so that  `S[0], S[1], ..., S[2*index+1]`  is valid. Clearly, every parentheses sequence has a unique  _closure number_. We can try to enumerate them individually.

For each closure number `c`, we know the starting and ending brackets must be at index `0` and `2*c + 1`. Then, the `2*c` elements between must be a valid sequence, plus the rest of the elements must be a valid sequence.
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        if n == 0: return ['']
        ans = []
        for c in range(n):
            for left in self.generateParenthesis(c):
                for right in self.generateParenthesis(n-1-c):
                    ans.append('({}){}'.format(left, right))
        return ans
```
