## Question:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters  `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by  **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)**  with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of  [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["h","e","l","l","o"]
**Output:** ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
**Output:** ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Python**
_Life is short, use Python._ (c)
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s):
        s.reverse()
```


**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
time complexity is `O(n*sqrt(n))`, because we have no more than `O(sqrt(n))` divisors of number `n` (we can split them into pairs, where one number in pair will be `<sqrt(n)`. 

**SC** 
Space compexity is `O(n)`.

**Approach 2: Recursion**
Recursive swap positions. Clean code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s):
        def helper(left, right):
            if left < right:
                s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
                helper(left + 1, right - 1)

        helper(0, len(s) - 1)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(n)  n/2 swaps


**SC** 
O(n) recursive stack

---

**Approach 3: 2 pointers**
Classic 2 pointers. In fact, `right = len(s) - 1 - left`. So one pointer.
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s):
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left, right = left + 1, right - 1
```
**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) n/2 swaps

SC:O(1) No extra space
