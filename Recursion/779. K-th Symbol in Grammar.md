## Question:

On the first row, we write a  `0`. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of  `0`  with  `01`, and each occurrence of  `1`  with  `10`.

Given row  `N`  and index  `K`, return the  `K`-th indexed symbol in row  `N`. (The values of  `K`  are 1-indexed.) (1 indexed).

**Examples:**
**Input:** N = 1, K = 1
**Output:** 0

**Input:** N = 2, K = 1
**Output:** 0

**Input:** N = 2, K = 2
**Output:** 1

**Input:** N = 4, K = 5
**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
row 3: 0110
row 4: 01101001

**Note:**

 -  `N`  will be an integer in the range  `[1, 30]`.
 -  `K`  will be an integer in the range  `[1, 2^(N-1)]`.
## Solution:


**Approach 1: Recursion**
The recursion pattern here is that:
- On Nth level:
	- if K is in the first half. Then its just the Kth value on (N-1)th level.
	- if K is in the second half. Then its just the (N-K)th value on (N-1)th level.
- On 1st level:
	- K can only be 1 and value is 0
```python
class Solution:
    def kthGrammar(self, N: int, K: int) -> int:
        if N == 1: return 0
        half = 2**(N-2)
        if K <= half:
            return self.kthGrammar(N-1, K)
        else:
            return 1 if self.kthGrammar(N-1, K-half) == 0 else 0
```
