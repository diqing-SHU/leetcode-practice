# 211. Add and Search Word - Data structure design

## Question

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addWord(word)
bool search(word)

search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters  `a-z`  or  `.`. A  `.`  means it can represent any one letter.

**Example:**

addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true

**Note:**  
You may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters  `a-z`.

## Solution

**Approach 1: Trie With Recursion changes to search**
Create the trie structure directly in `WordDictionary` class. So that we can recursively use its `search`function to deal with remaining word string.
In this case, when we search:

- We loop through word for the normal cases
- When we found `"."`, we switch to recursion solution. or all the results to see if any match and just return the result. Recursion will take care of the rest of word string for us.

```python
class WordDictionary:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False

    def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:
        """
        Adds a word into the data structure.
        """
        current = self
        for letter in word:
            if letter not in current.children:
                current.children[letter] = WordDictionary()
            current = current.children[letter]
        current.is_word = True
        

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        """
        Returns if the word is in the data structure. A word could contain the dot character '.' to represent any one letter.
        """
        current = self
        for i in range(len(word)):
            letter = word[i]
            if letter == ".":
                flag = False
                for x in current.children.values():
                 # Check if any match
                    flag = flag or x.search(word[i+1:])
                # Keep in mind recursion takes care of everything for word[i+1:]
                # The rest of word string, so just return
                return flag
            else:
             # Regular case
                if letter not in current.children:
                    return False
            current = current.children[letter]
        return current.is_word
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(m) In each step of the algorithm we search for the next key character. In the worst case the algorithm performs m operations (max length).

SC:O(1) Constant space used for operations. O(m) space usage for storing the data.

**Approach 2: Trie With Pure Recursion Search**
Not much different except pure recursion on the search

```python
class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}
    
    def addWord(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            node = node.setdefault(char, {})
        node[None] = None

    def search(self, word):
        def find(word, node):
            if not word:
                return None in node
            char, word = word[0], word[1:]
            if char != '.':
                return char in node and find(word, node[char])
            return any(find(word, kid) for kid in node.values() if kid)
        return find(word, self.root)

```

An iterative alternative for the  `search`  method:

```python
    def search(self, word):
        nodes = [self.root]
        for char in word:
            nodes = [kid
                     for node in nodes
                     for key, kid in node.items()
                     if char in (key, '.') and kid]
        return any(None in node for node in nodes)

```

And one that's a bit longer but faster:

```python
    def search(self, word):
        nodes = [self.root]
        for char in word:
            nodes = [kid for node in nodes for kid in
                     ([node[char]] if char in node else
                      filter(None, node.values()) if char == '.' else [])]
        return any(None in node for node in nodes)

```

And a neat version where I append my end-marker to the word to simplify the final check:

```python
class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}
    
    def addWord(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            node = node.setdefault(char, {})
        node['$'] = None

    def search(self, word):
        nodes = [self.root]
        for char in word + '$':
            nodes = [kid for node in nodes for kid in
                     ([node[char]] if char in node else
                      filter(None, node.values()) if char == '.' else [])]
        return bool(nodes)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(m) In each step of the algorithm we search for the next key character. In the worst case the algorithm performs m operations (max length).

SC:O(1) Constant space used for operations. O(m) space usage for storing the data.
