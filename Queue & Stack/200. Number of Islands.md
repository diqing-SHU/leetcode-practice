## Question:


Given a 2d grid map of  `'1'`s (land) and  `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
**Output:** 3
## Solution:
**Approach 1: DFS**
For each of 1 we found, use DFS to find land borders and then plus one to counter. Mark all `1`(land) as 0 so we don't over count each land.
Once all lands are processed, we can return the answer.
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        def dfs(grid, i, j):
            if i<0 or j<0 or i>=len(grid) or j>=len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '1':
                return
            grid[i][j] = '0'
            dfs(grid, i+1, j)
            dfs(grid, i-1, j)
            dfs(grid, i, j+1)
            dfs(grid, i, j-1)
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    dfs(grid, i, j)
                    count += 1
        return count
```
