## Question:


Given a list of daily temperatures  `T`, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put  `0`  instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures  `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, your output should be  `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.

**Note:**  The length of  `temperatures`  will be in the range  `[1, 30000]`. Each temperature will be an integer in the range  `[30, 100]`.

## Solution:


**BF**
For each day check until we find a warmer day or reach the end
```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if len(T) == 0:
            return []
        if len(T) == 1:
            return [0]
        p1, p2, count, counted = 0, 0, 0, []
        while p1 < len(T):
            if T[p1] < T[p2]:
                T[p1] = count
                count = 0
                p1+=1
                p2=p1
            # Since p2 is set to p1
            # It will count itself
            else:
                p2+=1
                count+=1
                if p2 == len(T):
                    count = 0
                    T[p1] = count
                    counted.pop(0)
                    p1+=1
                    p2=p1
                else:
                    counted.append(T[p2])
        return T
                    
```

**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**
O(n^2^) For each element, we need to check every element after it at worst case.

**SC**
O(1) No extra space

**Approach 2: Reduce redundant count**
If we start from right side, we can keep track of `right_max`. If current temperature is higher than `right_max`, we can put 0 since there are no higher temperature on the right. Otherwise, we start counting until we reached we find a higher temperature.
Notice we use previous counts to jump if we find lower temperature on our way.
```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n, right_max = len(T), float('-inf')
        res = [0] * n
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            t = T[i]
            if right_max <= t:
                right_max = t
            else:
                days = 1
                # Keep jumping
                while T[i+days] <= t:
                    days += res[i+days]
                res[i] = days
        return res
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC**
O(n) 
Even though the number of steps to jump (while loop) is NOT a constant, note that each element in a 'valley' will be accessed at most twice thanks to the leaps (consider the example `T=[5,4,5,1,2,3,4,6]`), the algorithm essentially only keeps the monotonously increasing part of the original sequence. Thus the complexity is O(n).

**SC**
O(n) holds res

**Approach 3: Stack**
If we go from right to left. We can use stack to keep track of temperatures that appear in descending order(possible warmer temperature)
```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0] * len(T)
        stack = [] #indexes from hottest to coldest
        for i in xrange(len(T) - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and T[i] >= T[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                ans[i] = stack[-1] - i
            stack.append(i)
        return ans
``` 
Every time a higher temperature is found, we update answer of the peak one in the stack.  
If the day with higher temperature is not found, we leave the ans to be the default `0`.
```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        ans = [0]*len(T)
        for i in range(len(T)):
            while len(stack) > 0 and T[stack[-1]] < T[i]:
                j = stack.pop()
                ans[j] = i-j
            stack.append(i)
        return ans
```
We can also make use of `enumerate()` to prettify the code
```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
	    ans = [0] * len(T)
	    stack = []
	    for i, t in enumerate(T):
	      while stack and T[stack[-1]] < t:
	        prev_idx = stack.pop()
	        ans[prev_idx] = i - prev_idx
	      stack.append(i)
	    return ans
```
**Complexity Analysis**

TC:O(n) Math is hard but so efficient

SC:O(n) Stack used
