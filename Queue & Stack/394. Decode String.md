## Question:



Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is:  `k[encoded_string]`, where the  _encoded_string_  inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly  _k_  times. Note that  _k_  is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers,  _k_. For example, there won't be input like  `3a`  or  `2[4]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "3[a]2[bc]"
**Output:** "aaabcbc"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "3[a2[c]]"
**Output:** "accaccacc"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
**Output:** "abcabccdcdcdef"

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "abc3[cd]xyz"
**Output:** "abccdcdcdxyz"
## Solution:


**Approach 1: One pass with stack**
A perfect place to use a stack.
Put the word and number into the stack, when we encounter a `'['` to get ready to record the word.
When we encounter a `']'`, we apply our changes to the current recorded string with last number and connect that to our last recorded word to get ready for next `']'`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def decodeString(self, s):
        stack = []; curNum = 0; curString = ''
        for c in s:
	        # Store recorded string and number to get ready to record next
            if c == '[':
                stack.append(curString)
                stack.append(curNum)
                curString = ''
                curNum = 0
            # One word just closed, handle the last one, append it to our prevString stored
            elif c == ']':
                num = stack.pop()
                prevString = stack.pop()
                curString = prevString + num*curString
            # Record 
            elif c.isdigit():
                curNum = curNum*10 + int(c)
            else:
                curString += c
        return curString
```


**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). One pass


**SC** 
O(n). 1 stack
