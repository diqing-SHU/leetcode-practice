# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

  

  

## Question:

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

-   push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
-   pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
-   peek() -- Get the front element.
-   empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

**Example:**

MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false

**Notes:**

-   You must use  _only_  standard operations of a stack -- which means only  `push to top`,  `peek/pop from top`,  `size`, and  `is empty`  operations are valid.
-   Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
-   You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
## Solution:


**Approach 1: One temp Stacks**
Use a temp stack to hold value while doing pop (remove all values til we reach 1st one)
```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.list = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        """
        Push element x to the back of queue.
        """
        self.list.append(x)
        

    def pop(self) -> int:
        """
        Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element.
        """
        temp = []
        while len(self.list) > 0:
            temp.append(self.list.pop())
        res = temp.pop()
        while len(temp) > 0:
            self.list.append(temp.pop())
        return res

    def peek(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the front element.
        """
        temp = []
        currLen = len(self.list)
        while len(self.list) > 0:
            temp.append(self.list.pop())
        while len(temp) > 0:
            if currLen == len(temp):
                res = temp.pop()
                self.list.append(res)
            else:
                self.list.append(temp.pop())
        return res

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns whether the queue is empty.
        """
        return len(self.list) == 0


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```


**Complexity Analysis**

**TC** 
O(1) push. O(n) pop

**SC** 
O(n) two stacks

**Approach 2: Two stack**
I have one input stack, onto which I push the incoming elements, and one output stack, from which I peek/pop. I move elements from input stack to output stack when needed, i.e., when I need to peek/pop but the output stack is empty. When that happens, I move all elements from input to output stack, thereby reversing the order so it's the correct order for peek/pop.

The loop in  `peek`  does the moving from input to output stack. Each element only ever gets moved like that once, though, and only after we already spent time pushing it, so the overall amortized cost for each operation is O(1).


```python
class Queue(object):
    def __init__(self):
        """
        initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.inStack, self.outStack = [], []

    def push(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: nothing
        """
        self.inStack.append(x)

    def pop(self):
        """
        :rtype: nothing
        """
        self.move()
        self.outStack.pop()

    def peek(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.move()
        return self.outStack[-1]

    def empty(self):
        """
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return (not self.inStack) and (not self.outStack) 
        
    def move(self):
        """
        :rtype nothing
        """
        if not self.outStack:
            while self.inStack:
                self.outStack.append(self.inStack.pop())
```

**SC** 
O(n). 2 stacks
