## Question:
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3

**Example 2:**

Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2

**Example 3:**

Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1

**Follow up:**

Your algorithm should run in  _O_(_n_) time and uses constant extra space.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Set**
Store the non-negative values to set, so we avoid duplicate. Loop from 1 to length of set to see if any one is not in the set. if we couldn't find. We know that `AppearanceSet` is from `1` to `len(AppearanceSet)`. And the next one must be our answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        AppearanceSet = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num > 0 and num not in AppearanceSet:
                AppearanceSet.add(num)
        for i in range(1,len(AppearanceSet)+1):
            if i not in AppearanceSet:
                return i
        return len(AppearanceSet)+1
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) One pass the `nums` + one pass the `AppearanceSet`

**SC** 
O(n) Our appearance set

**Approach 2: Array as Hash-map**

Basic idea:
   1. for any array whose length is `l`, the first missing positive must be in range `[1,...,l+1]`, 
        so we only have to care about those elements in this range and remove the rest. Notice we also removed value that equals to`l + 1`, since it can only be answer if all elements are simply `[1,...,l]` and for that case we will have 0 frequency for `l + 1` hash.
   2. we can use the array index as the hash to restore the frequency of each number within 
         the range `[1,...,l+1]`. Since all elements are less than `l+1`, we can add `l+1` to represent 1 appearance and keep the original value as `nums[i]%(l+1)`
   3. Then, we loop through our "Hash-map" to find one with 0 frequency (`nums[i]<l+1`).

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.append(0)
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)): #delete those useless elements
            if nums[i]<0 or nums[i]>=n:
                nums[i]=0
        for i in range(len(nums)): #use the index as the hash to record the frequency of each number
            nums[nums[i]%n]+=n
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i]<n:
                return i
        return n
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) 3 pass the array

**SC** 
O(1) No extra space

**Approach 3: Binary Search on Logarithms**
Notice, that first missinig positive will always be in range  `1,2,...n,n+1`, where  `n`  is length of  `nums`. Let us rearrange numbers, putting each number on its place: number  `i`  on place  `i-1`  (because indexes start with  `0`): let us iterate over our numbers and change two numbers if one of them not on its place: we break if number not in range  `1,...,n`  or if we are trying to put number on the place, which is already occupied with this place (because we have infinite loop in this case)

When we iterate all numbers we find for number which is not on its place, using  `i == nums[i] - 1`. It can happen that all numbers between  `1`  and  `n`  are here, so I add  `[0]`  to the end. Finally, I found index of  `False`  in this array: it will be our number.
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
	        # We stop if the value is out of range of answer
	        # Or we already have a correct one in place (Duplicated)
            while 0 <= nums[i]-1 < len(nums) and nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]:
	            # We need temp since we will change nums[i] first in this case
                tmp = nums[i]-1
                nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1] = nums[nums[i]-1], nums[i]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i+1:
                return i+1
        return len(nums)+1
```
We can make it shorter with iterator:
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
	        # We stop if the value is out of range of answer
	        # Or we already have a correct one in place (Duplicated)
            while nums[i]-1 in range(n) and nums[i] != nums[nums[i]-1]:
	            # Swap so we dont lose value
	            # Dont need temp since we will change nums[i] later in this case
                nums[nums[i]-1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]
                
        return next((i + 1 for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num != i + 1), n + 1)  
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n) Even though we have `while` loop inside `for` loop, complexity will be `O(n)`:on each step we put at least one number to its proper place

**SC** 
O(1) No extra space
