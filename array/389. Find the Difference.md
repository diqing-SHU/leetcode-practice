## Question:

Given two strings  **_s_**  and  **_t_**  which consist of only lowercase letters.

String  **_t_**  is generated by random shuffling string  **_s_**  and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in  **_t_**.

**Example:**

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: HashMap**
Use a HashMap to store all elements in `s` string. Then, use it while looping through `t` string.

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        dic = {}
        for ch in s:
            dic[ch] = dic.get(ch, 0) + 1
        for ch in t:
            if dic.get(ch, 0) == 0:
                return ch
            else:
                dic[ch] -= 1
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). One pass both string

**SC** 
O(n) the `dict` stores all elements

---

**Approach 2: Difference**
Chars have ascii code which is essentially numbers. if we sum all chars in `s` and `t`, the difference will be the value for the extra char. We can use `char()` to construct it in the end.

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        diff = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            diff -= ord(s[i])
            diff += ord(t[i])
        diff += ord(t[-1])
        return chr(diff)
```



**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). One pass both string

**SC** 
O(1) We only have `diff` variable

---

**Approach 3: XOR**
XOR cancels same elements, if we do it for all chars in `s` and `t`, we will be left with the extra char.
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        code = 0
        for ch in s + t:
            code ^= ord(ch)
        return chr(code)
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n). One pass both string

**SC** 
O(1) We only have `code` variable
