## Question:

Given an array  `A`  of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of  `A`, followed by all the odd elements of  `A`.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,1,2,4]
**Output:** [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= A.length <= 5000`
2.  `0 <= A[i] <= 5000`
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: One pass In-place**
One pass in place with condition based on element value.
Tattoo this magic code!
```python
    def sortArrayByParity(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if A[i]%2 == 0:
                A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]
                j+=1
        return A
```
