# 713. Subarray Product Less Than K

## Question:


Your are given an array of positive integers  `nums`.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than  `k`.

**Example 1:**  

**Input:** nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

**Note:**

-   `0 < nums.length <= 50000`.
-   `0 < nums[i] < 1000`.
-   `0 <= k < 10^6`.
## Solution:
**Approach 1: Brute Force**
For each element in array, we treat it as the beginning of a possible solution. Count all suitable sub arrays till we reach the end or go above k.

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            tempProduct = nums[i]
            if tempProduct < k:
                ans+=1
                j = i + 1
                while j < len(nums):
                    tempProduct *= nums[j]
                    if tempProduct < k:
                        ans+=1
                    else:
                        break
                    j+=1
        return ans
```
**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(n^2^) For each element in array, we calculate subarray till the end. `O(n*(n+1)/2)` => `O(n^2)`

**SC** 
O(1) we only store number of solutions

**Approach 2: Sliding Window**
Our loop invariant is that  `left`  is the smallest value so that the product in the window  `prod = nums[left] * nums[left + 1] * ... * nums[right]`  is less than  `k`.

For every right, we update  `left`  and  `prod`  to maintain this invariant. Then, the number of intervals with subarray product less than  `k`  and with right-most coordinate  `right`, is  `right - left + 1`. We'll count all of these for each value of  `right`.

let's use the example  `nums = [10,5,2,6]`:

-   If we start at the 0th index,  `[`**`10`**`,5,2,6]`, the number of intervals is obviously 1.
-   If we move to the 1st index, the window is now  `[`**`10,5`**`,2,6]`. The new intervals created are  `[5]`  and  `[10,5]`, so we add 2.
-   Now, expand the window to the 2nd index:  `[`**`10,5,2`**`,6]`. The new intervals are  `[2]`,  `[5,2]`, and  `[10,5,2]`, so we add 3.
-   The pattern should be obvious by now; we add  `right - left + 1`  to the output variable every loop!

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if k <= 1: return 0
        prod = 1
        ans = left = 0
        for right, val in enumerate(nums):
            prod *= val
            # Time to move our left bound
            # So the window is still valid
            while prod >= k:
                prod /= nums[left]
                left += 1
            ans += right - left + 1
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**
**TC** 
O(N), where N is the length of `nums`. `left` can only be incremented at most `N` times.

**SC** 
O(1) We only track counts
