## Question:

Given an array  `nums`, write a function to move all  `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

**Input:** `[0,1,0,3,12]`
**Output:** `[1,3,12,0,0]`

**Note**:

1.  You must do this  **in-place**  without making a copy of the array.
2.  Minimize the total number of operations.
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: 2 Pointers**
Loop through array with 2 pointers:
1. `p1` only stops if its not 0, otherwise keeps moving forward
2. `p2` only stops if its 0, otherwise keeps moving forward
3. while they both stop, we check if `p1` is on the left side of `p2`. Because we only want to swap 0 to the next available non-0 number. if not, we put `p1` at `p2` and continue
4. When `p2` moves out of the bound, we stop because the rest are all 0s
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        p1, p2 = 0, 0
        while p1 < len(nums) and p2 < len(nums):
            if nums[p1] != 0:
                p1+=1
            if nums[p2] == 0:
                p2+=1
            if nums[p1] == 0 and nums[p2] != 0:
	            if p1 < p2:
	                nums[p1], nums[p2] = nums[p2], nums[p1]
                else
	                p2 = p1
                
```
Cool solution to put non-0 to begining of the array. won't lose data
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[j], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[j]
                j += 1
```
