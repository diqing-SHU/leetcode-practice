# 485. Max Consecutive Ones

  

  

## Question:


Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

**Example 1:**  

**Input:** [1,1,0,1,1,1]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

**Note:**

-   The input array will only contain  `0`  and  `1`.
-   The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Count Max**
Simply loop through while counting the global max, since we only need the **consecutive** ones
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSum = 0;
        currSum = 0;
        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                currSum+=1
            else:
                maxSum = max(currSum,maxSum)
                currSum = 0
        maxSum = max(currSum,maxSum)
        return maxSum
```

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n) One loop through

  

SC:O(1) Constant space

**Approach 2: List to string**
List join to string
Split with "0" back to list
And some other magic
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		return max(list(map(len, ("".join(list(map(str, nums)))).split('0'))))
```
