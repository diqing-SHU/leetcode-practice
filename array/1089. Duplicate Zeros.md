## Question:


Given a fixed length array  `arr`  of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array  **in place**, do not return anything from your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
**Output:** null
**Explanation:** After calling your function, the **input** array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,2,3]
**Output:** null
**Explanation:** After calling your function, the **input** array is modified to: [1,2,3]

**Note:**

1.  `1 <= arr.length <= 10000`
2.  `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`
## Solution:

  

**Approach 1: Shift the list for every 0**
Simply loop through while squaring the value. Rely on Python `sort()` to order.
```python
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        i1 = 0
        while i1 < len(arr):
            if arr[i1] == 0:
                i2 = len(arr)-1
                while i2 > i1:
                    arr[i2] = arr[i2-1]
                    i2-=1
                i1+=1
            i1+=1
```

**Complexity Analysis**

  

TC:O(n^2) It can be really slow

  

SC:O(1) Constant space

**Approach 2: Two pass**
1st pass to find the last element of our new list if we would finished the duplication of 0s
2nd pass from that position to index 0 while copying data over to the list (from the end)
```python
class Solution:
    def duplicateZeros(self, arr: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify arr in-place instead.
        """
        possible_dups = 0
        length_ = len(arr) - 1

        # Find the number of zeros to be duplicated
        for left in range(length_ + 1):

            # Stop when left points beyond the last element in the original list
            # which would be part of the modified list
            if left > length_ - possible_dups:
                break

            # Count the zeros
            if arr[left] == 0:
                # Edge case: This zero can't be duplicated. We have no more space,
                # as left is pointing to the last element which could be included  
                if left == length_ - possible_dups:
                    arr[length_] = 0 # For this zero we just copy it without duplication.
                    length_ -= 1
                    break
                possible_dups += 1

        # Start backwards from the last element which would be part of new list.
        last = length_ - possible_dups
        
        # Copy zero twice, and non zero once.
        for i in range(last, -1, -1):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                arr[i + possible_dups] = 0
                possible_dups -= 1
                arr[i + possible_dups] = 0
            else:
                arr[i + possible_dups] = arr[i]
```
